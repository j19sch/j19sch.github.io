    <summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2023/making-meetings-work/venn-meeting.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often I've heard people say: &lt;em&gt;"Oh no, not another meeting!"&lt;/em&gt; Usually this means they feel their time at work is split between time in meetings and time in which they do actual work. And to be fair, they have a point. I too have been in plenty of meetings that didn't achieve much of anything. It doesn't have to be this way, however. Meetings can be effective and they can leave you with a real sense of having accomplished something. And in this post I'll explain how to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We struggle with meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
            &lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2023/making-meetings-work/sisyphus-titian.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Sisyphus by Titian"&gt;
            &lt;figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"&gt;Sisyphus by Titian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;
            &lt;p style="margin-top:10px"&gt;We struggle with meetings. On the one hand we keep proposing them, scheduling them, attending them. On the other hand we keep complaining about them. We feel sorry for people with a day full of meetings. When a meeting ends early, we &lt;em&gt;"get 10 minutes of our lives back"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1179798961131012096"&gt;I say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you feel you do all your work outside of meetings, you're meeting wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's something I realized while I was a scrum master: my work happens during meetings. Mostly team meetings and 1-to-1s. There's prep before and follow-up after meetings, but I did the core of my job through meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2022/k-cards/k-cards.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;K-cards are often used at peer conferences to facilitate the discussion after someone has presented their experience report. Some people really hate them. In my experience they're a great tool to enable rich conversations. Since the facilitator uses the K-cards to structure the discussion in threads, K-cards allow the group to drill down to the details of the experience report. This instead of the conversation jumping around as person 1 broaches topic A, person 2 introduces topic B, and person 3 wants to return to topic A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation of these K-cards often takes the form of &lt;em&gt;"This is what each card means."&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;"This is when to use this card for what purpose."&lt;/em&gt; And despite the elegance of the K-cards system, when you learn about them during the opening of a peer conference, it's a lot of information to digest. So I hope this blog post will be useful as a written explanation of how to use K-cards.&lt;/p&gt;
