    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is a slightly edited version of the experience report I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://smallsheds.garden/slides/xp2023-quality-engineer.html"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/xp2023/"&gt;xp2023&lt;/a&gt; conference. It covers my first six months at a scale-up, working as a quality engineer for the first time - after having worked in other testing-related roles for 15+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main finding is that for a quality engineering role to work well, certain structures need to be in place. The most important one is that the impact the quality engineer is expected to have, is clear to both the quality engineer and the team(s) they are supporting. However, regardless of which structures you put in place, a quality engineer will also need to work around those structures to be fully effective.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the second &lt;a href="https://frogsconf.nl/"&gt;FroGS conf Open Space&lt;/a&gt; on 12 March 2022 I facilitated a session based on my blog post &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/four-skills-to-embody-the-four-agile-values/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Four skills to embody the four Agile values"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My goal with the session was to uncover more Agile (micro-)skills. In this post I'll share what we did during the session and I'll close off with some thoughts on the biggest challenge of this exercise: too many skills. Before I start however, a big thank you to everyone who participated in the session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the session with asking people to add stickies to the board of things they valued in Agile software development. When was I preparing the Miro board before the session, I labeled this part of the board "values". Then I remembered I had decided earlier to label it "what we value", so as to avoid the discussion about what values are and aren't. The topic did come up (i.e. the relation between values, ethics and morals), so I was glad I could respond by saying it's a great topic, but not for this session.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had a time machine and could travel back in time to give myself some advice before attending &lt;a href="http://lets-test.com/"&gt;Let's Test 20212&lt;/a&gt;,
it would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Go!&lt;br&gt;
- Don't worry too much about which session to attend. One of the most valuable sessions you will attend, you'll choose because it has the least appealing abstract.&lt;br&gt;
- Bring your running gear.&lt;br&gt;
- If you ask Rikard Edgren nicely, he will give you a dead-tree version of his '&lt;a href="http://www.thetesteye.com/papers/TheLittleBlackBookOnTestDesign.pdf"&gt;Little Black Book on Test Design&lt;/a&gt;'.&lt;br&gt;
- Enjoy the food. Don't worry, it's not much of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2012/lets-test-2012-time-travel-advice/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (1 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>
