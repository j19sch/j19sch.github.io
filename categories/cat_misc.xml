&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="https://agilecommshandbook.com/"&gt;"The agile comms handbook"&lt;/a&gt; I'm experimenting with a &lt;strong&gt;weekly (internal) blog&lt;/strong&gt;. No big promises on the content, just the things I feel like writing about at the end of my week. And as this is an experiment, things might change along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to add a &lt;strong&gt;comment, respond&lt;/strong&gt; to other people's comments and/or &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; with others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll tell the story of my eight-month experiment with weekly notes. After that, I'll share some tips in case you want to give weekly notes a try too.&lt;/p&gt;

Initially, I didn't have a system, I just wrote things down. Then, about seven years ago, when I became a scrum master, my notebook became more important. As a tester, I could use my team's board to keep track of my work. As a scrum master, none of my work was on the board. And even though my role has changed several times since then, my need for keeping track of things hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So somewhere along the way - and to be honest I forgot when exactly - I created my own system of note-taking based on bullet journaling. It's simple and straightforward. It helps me plan my day, list possible future actions, and keep a record of what I've been doing. On the one hand it seems like something small and simple. On the other hand it has been a major help to me, so I figured it's worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

So today I decided to fix that. The result is the scale below with which you can measure review coverage. And just like all good scales, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuzpsO4ErOQ"&gt;it goes all the way up to 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0) I'm sorry, what document?&lt;br&gt;
1) I think I do remember someone mentioning that document.&lt;br&gt;
2) I'm sure I have it somewhere – well, at least fairly sure...&lt;br&gt;
3) Look, it's on my to do-pile!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2012/measuring-review-coverage/"&gt;Read more…&lt;/a&gt; (1 min remaining to read)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>coverage</category><category>measurements</category><category>reviews</category><guid>https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2012/measuring-review-coverage/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Sep 2012 17:39:57 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
