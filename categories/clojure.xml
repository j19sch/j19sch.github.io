Now you might wonder: does your choice of editor really matter that much? You're learning the language, so you don't need advanced IDE features. Some syntax highlighting, some code completion, something to help you manage all those parantheses perhaps, done. That would be true if not for the Clojure REPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Clojure REPL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction"&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt; is definitely a Thing™️ in Clojure. It gives you a prompt where you can type code and it will execute it immediately. You can also load files with code into it, interacting with the functions and data defined in those. So that's a signifcantly faster feedback loop than having to compile and then run - which is how you'd normally run something written in Clojure, since its primary platform is the JVM. There are &lt;a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/launching_a_basic_repl"&gt;different ways&lt;/a&gt; of launching a REPL, but most guides I found tell you to use &lt;a href="https://leiningen.org/"&gt;Leiningen&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, and REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print_Loop, because that's what the REPL does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely feels like this REPL is a bigger deal than I appreciate right now. Probably because I have only just begun learning Clojure. On the other hand, I may have also been spoiled by the quick feedback provided by Python and its &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html"&gt;IDLE&lt;/a&gt;. On the third hand, it's only because of learning of the Clojure REPL, I looked into importing files into Python's IDLE and found out that's indeed a thing it can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago (meaning I don't remember when but it's been a while) I learned about a programming language called Lisp. It was said that by studying this language you'd gain &lt;a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html"&gt;deep insights&lt;/a&gt; into programming and you'd never write code the same way again. That definitely piqued my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time later (don't remember when exactly either) I learned about the existence of Clojure and that it too, was something special. So I added it to the list of programming languages I wanted to learn some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, earlier this month, I felt the need to start a new project. To learn something new. So I figured I'd learn Lisp. That didn't last long though, as I found out that the recommended editor for Lisp is Emacs. And from trying out Emacs and vi about 20 years ago I knew that for some reason vi does fit with how my mind works, and Emacs doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
