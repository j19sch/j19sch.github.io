    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;level 0: no one takes notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few things confuse me as much as being a meeting with no one taking notes. Is everyone's memory so much better than my own? Is what's being said just not that important? Are people fine with only retaining a few things and nothing else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I'm not alone. Johanna Rothman seems to agree with me, at least for &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; meetings:&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2025/five-levels-of-note-taking-in-meetings/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a meeting is essential, it will have an agenda. It will have minutes. It will have a list of action items, and someone will manage them so that people are accountable for their action items.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy"&gt;Modern Management Made Easy&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.jrothman.com/"&gt;Johanna Rothman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why it's level 0. There's no reason to ever be at this level. Borrow some pen and paper. use your phone. The least you can do is take notes for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Fluxx ensemble exercise</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2024/ensemble.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I ran a &lt;a href="https://hustef.hu/joep_schuurkes_2024/"&gt;full-day workshop&lt;/a&gt; at the excellent &lt;a href="https://hustef.hu/"&gt;HUSTEF&lt;/a&gt; conference on working in an ensemble (aka mob programming/testing or software teaming). As part of the workshop I tried out a new exercise, in which participants were allowed to change the rules of the ensemble. The goal was to experience why the basic rules of ensembling are the way they are and what happens if they are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the participants really liked the exercise, I figured I'd write about it and name it: the Fluxx ensemble exercise. For those not familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.looneylabs.com/games/fluxx"&gt;Fluxx&lt;/a&gt;: it is a card game in which changing the rules is a key part of the game. It's one of my favourite games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into the exercise, though, I'll first need to explain the basic rules of ensembling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making meetings work</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2023/making-meetings-work/venn-meeting.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often I've heard people say: &lt;em&gt;"Oh no, not another meeting!"&lt;/em&gt; Usually this means they feel their time at work is split between time in meetings and time in which they do actual work. And to be fair, they have a point. I too have been in plenty of meetings that didn't achieve much of anything. It doesn't have to be this way, however. Meetings can be effective and they can leave you with a real sense of having accomplished something. And in this post I'll explain how to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We struggle with meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;
            &lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2023/making-meetings-work/sisyphus-titian.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Sisyphus by Titian"&gt;
            &lt;figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"&gt;Sisyphus by Titian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;
            &lt;p style="margin-top:10px"&gt;We struggle with meetings. On the one hand we keep proposing them, scheduling them, attending them. On the other hand we keep complaining about them. We feel sorry for people with a day full of meetings. When a meeting ends early, we &lt;em&gt;"get 10 minutes of our lives back"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1179798961131012096"&gt;I say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you feel you do all your work outside of meetings, you're meeting wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's something I realized while I was a scrum master: my work happens during meetings. Mostly team meetings and 1-to-1s. There's prep before and follow-up after meetings, but I did the core of my job through meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Structuring group discussions with K-cards</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2022/k-cards/k-cards.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;K-cards are often used at peer conferences to facilitate the discussion after someone has presented their experience report. Some people really hate them. In my experience they're a great tool to enable rich conversations. Since the facilitator uses the K-cards to structure the discussion in threads, K-cards allow the group to drill down to the details of the experience report. This instead of the conversation jumping around as person 1 broaches topic A, person 2 introduces topic B, and person 3 wants to return to topic A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation of these K-cards often takes the form of &lt;em&gt;"This is what each card means."&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;"This is when to use this card for what purpose."&lt;/em&gt; And despite the elegance of the K-cards system, when you learn about them during the opening of a peer conference, it's a lot of information to digest. So I hope this blog post will be useful as a written explanation of how to use K-cards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to run a remote Elephant Carpaccio</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/two-times-remote-elephant-carpaccio/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I promised to write a blog post on how I would run remote &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171114154855/http://alistair.cockburn.us/Elephant+Carpaccio+exercise"&gt;Elephant Carpaccio&lt;/a&gt; if I get the opportunity to run it a third time. This is that post, but not exactly. In the mean time I got the opportunity to run the workshop one more time. That gave me the opportunity to try out some new things and write this blog post on how to run a remote Elephant Carpaccio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be clear on one thing, though. This post is not a full facilitation guide. It can't be with the limited experience I have. I do hope and think that reading the official(?) &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCuuu-8Mm14oxsOnlk8DqfZAA1cvtYu9WGv67Yj_sSk/pub"&gt;facilitation guide&lt;/a&gt; and this blog post, gives you a solid base to start running the Elephant Carpaccio exercise remotely yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your time to prep. Taking &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/lessons-learned-after-facilitating-elephant-carpaccio/#take-your-time-for-the-before-and-after"&gt;as much time as the duration&lt;/a&gt; of the workshop is a good start. (That's assuming you are already familiar with the Elephant Carpaccio exercise, though. So if you're not, do that first.) Get a clear picture in your head what you want to achieve with the workshop. Run through it in your mind in detail. Decide which options you have in which parts of the workshop to make changes as the workshop happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lessons learned after facilitating remote Elephant Carpaccio</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/two-times-remote-elephant-carpaccio/"&gt;previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; I shared my experience of facilitating remote Elephant Carpaccio  twice. In this second post I want to share some things I learned through that experience that apply to facilitating remote experiential workshops in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The facilitation guide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elephant Carpaccio exercise has a detailed &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TCuuu-8Mm14oxsOnlk8DqfZAA1cvtYu9WGv67Yj_sSk/pub"&gt;facilitation guide&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg"&gt;Henrik Kniberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/totheralistair"&gt;Alistair Cockburn&lt;/a&gt; (also inventor of the exercise). This guide really is a blessing and a curse. It's great to have guidance on how to run the exercise. However, there's also only so much such a guide can do. As I was writing the blog post of me running the exercise twice, I looked at the facilitation guide again, and it made so much more sense to me. Instead of it being instructions about something new, I could connect the contents to my own experiences. And that experience does make me wonder how advisable it is to facilitate an exercise you have never done or seen based on a luckily excellent and very detailed faciliation guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level of detail in the facilitation guide also had me walk into the trap of relying on it too much. Instead of taking my own context fully into account, I though I could follow the guide with a few tweaks. As you could read in my &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/two-times-remote-elephant-carpaccio/"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, the first time I ran the exercise, it got away from me a little. In this sense I find it interesting that Oliver Spann seems to have had &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@olivercecilspann/elephant-carpaccio-exercise-an-experience-report-207f0cc79c34"&gt;a similar experience&lt;/a&gt; facilitating Elephant Carpaccio for the first time:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two times remote Elephant Carpaccio</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A while ago I asked the teams in my department which parts of agile software development they wanted to learn more about. One of the topics that stood out, was: you have a high-level description of a new feature, then what? That's still quite a wide topic, so the question become on what part of that problem would I focus first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite quickly I settled on feature slicing - for several reasons. First of all, I had noticed teams delivering somewhat big chunks of functionality, split up into development tasks instead of vertical slices. Secondly, a team I had worked with on feature slicing, had gained some valuable planning flexibility because of it. And they continued the practice, breaking up projects vertically. Finally, I was aware that there was a workshop called "Elephant Carpaccio", focused on feature slicing. So I could use that, or build on it, but at least I wouldn't have to come up with something from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Elephant Carpaccio exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elephant Carpaccio exercise was invented by Alistair Cockburn&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/two-times-remote-elephant-carpaccio/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Its purpose is to get people to practice &lt;em&gt;"nano-incremental"&lt;/em&gt; development, i.e. slicing something small enough you can program it in 15-30 minutes. The exercise tries to bring home its point through exageration: you are asked to slice a very simple application in 15-20 slices, where you would normally do it in 2-3 slices. Then you get five iterations of 8 minutes to build those slices. To me that's the coolest part of the exercise: you actually get to experience what's it like to work with such small slices. As Alistair Cockburn himself says about the exercise: &lt;em&gt;"the true learning is the actual programming section"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
