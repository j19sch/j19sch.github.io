    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the second &lt;a href="https://frogsconf.nl/"&gt;FroGS conf Open Space&lt;/a&gt; on 12 March 2022 I facilitated a session based on my blog post &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/four-skills-to-embody-the-four-agile-values/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Four skills to embody the four Agile values"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My goal with the session was to uncover more Agile (micro-)skills. In this post I'll share what we did during the session and I'll close off with some thoughts on the biggest challenge of this exercise: too many skills. Before I start however, a big thank you to everyone who participated in the session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the session with asking people to add stickies to the board of things they valued in Agile software development. When was I preparing the Miro board before the session, I labeled this part of the board "values". Then I remembered I had decided earlier to label it "what we value", so as to avoid the discussion about what values are and aren't. The topic did come up (i.e. the relation between values, ethics and morals), so I was glad I could respond by saying it's a great topic, but not for this session.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're familiar with the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, you're familiar with its four values:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working software over comprehensive documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responding to change over following a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently this made me wonder: how do you apply these values? How do you live them? What skills do you need to embody them? In this post I won't be sharing any definitive or complete answers, but as a starting point I have identified four skills needed to embody the four Agile values.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An approach to teaching Agile 20 years after the Agile Manifesto</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks I've been thinking about how I would teach Agile&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 2021, 20 years after the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; was published. After sharing my thoughts at &lt;a href="https://citconf.com/virtual2021/"&gt;CitCon Europe 2021 Virtual&lt;/a&gt; and having an interesting conversation about the state of Agile and how to teach it, I figured it's time to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I started thinking about this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Allan Kelly stated in a &lt;a href="https://www.allankellyassociates.co.uk/archives/2762/agile-won-the-war-but-lost-the-peace/"&gt;2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Agile won the war but lost the peace."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is doing Agile, even though very few people are living the dream promised by Agile. This makes it very difficult to use "Agile" as a label, as a name for something. When someone says "Agile", are they referring to what you're already doing or to something they think you should be doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html"&gt;written in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, based on what its authors were doing in the 1990s in response to the common ways of doing software development of that time. And since the Manifesto we've seen the introduction of Lean, of DevOps, and of CI/CD. So the amount of history that comes with Agile is large and it raises the question how much (if any) we should teach - especially since a lot of it is folklore instead of history&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Doing Agile's history justice would probably cost more time than makes sense if your goal is to teach people how to develop software in an Agile way&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And a lot of that history was a relatively long time ago, which is why I titled my CitCon session "Teaching Agile to people younger than the Manifesto".&lt;/p&gt;
