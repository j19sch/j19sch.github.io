    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post was first published on the DEWT site as part of a &lt;a href="https://dewt.wordpress.com/category/why-am-i-context-driven/"&gt;blog post series&lt;/a&gt; by the DEWT members .)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I context-driven? Because it's more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I could argue that becoming context-driven has made me a better tester and I do think it has. Yet it's not the reason I became a context-driven tester. Besides, how would I prove it made me a better tester?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, I am context-driven because it's more fun. Because it sees testing as an intellectual challenge. Because it allows human uncertainty to be at the core of what it is. Because it tells me that I'm in charge of what I do and how I do it. Because it encourages me to dive in at the deep end of some complex problem, trusting on my skills to get out on top and enjoying every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend the third Dutch Exploratory Workshop in Testing (DEWT3 for short) took place. The ingredients were: a very nice hotel in the woods, lots of talk about testing, beer, whiskey, a small to moderate amount of sleep, stickies and a group of fun and interesting people (You can see them &lt;a href="http://dewt.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/dewt3-experience-reports/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the talks (and thus discussions) were about systems thinking. A few years ago I did read Jerry Weinberg's "An Introduction to General Systems Thinking" and although a very interesting read, w.r.t. to applying it to testing I never got further then: Software is (part of) a system, so you can apply systems thinking to it. Of course, that's very much true, but it's also quite a vague piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A primer on systems thinking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter James Bach, who kicked off DEWT3 with a primer on systems thinking. Systems thinking is just a way of thinking - just like logical thinking, analogical thinking, creative thinking, etc. - in which we approach a situation as being a system. So what's a system? It's a set of things in a meaningful interaction with each other.
This definition raises all sorts of questions relevant in systems thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DEWT2 - Becoming a context-driven tester</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a month ago ago (October 5th - 6th) I was in Driebergen to attend &lt;a href="http://dewt.wordpress.com/2012/10/07/dewt2-was-a-blast/"&gt;DEWT2&lt;/a&gt;, a peer workshop with as theme "Implementing Context-Driven Testing". As it turns out, implementing context-driven testing is not easy to do. That should not come as a surprise: it requires people to change and that is difficult. Luckily, I'm not a manager wanting to implement context-driven testing, so I can dodge most of that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do like 'spreading the word' on context-driven testing, because I would like for there to be more context-driven testers in the Netherlands (and Europe and the world, of course). So to promote context-driven testing I think there are three things I can do: &lt;br&gt;
1) set an example,&lt;br&gt;
2) be available to other people,&lt;br&gt;
3) leave bread crumbs.&lt;/p&gt;
