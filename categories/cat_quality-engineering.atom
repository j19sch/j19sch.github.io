    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months ago I started a new job as a quality engineer, supporting two teams. So far it's been an interesting challenge. The two teams were formed only a few months before I joined, although some team members had been working for the company before that. Each team has their own product manager. We also have an engineering manager, but he joined only two weeks before I did. And then I was added to the mix, with a job description that didn't give a lot more guidance than: support the team in things related to testing and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my first task in my new job was figuring out what my job was. Or rather, figure out what concrete things I could do that fit that job description. This was not made easier by the fact that we're a fully remote company. Not being in the same space throughout the day does make things harder when you're trying to find your place. Reflecting on the past three months made me realize there are three things that are really important: visibility, connections, and patience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her article &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041001003124/http://www.qualitytree.com/feature/btwq.pdf"&gt;"Better Testing, Worse Quality?"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ruby.social/@testobsessed"&gt;Elisabeth Hendrickson&lt;/a&gt; makes an interesting case about independent testing, i.e. testing done by an independent test team. She discovered that beyond a certain point, investigating more in independent testing will make both quality and speed go down, not up. In &lt;a href="https://itrevolution.com/podcast/the-idealcast-episode-3/"&gt;episode 3&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://itrevolution.com/podcast/"&gt;Idealcast&lt;/a&gt;, she summarizes her article as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[...] when you ramp up the amount of investment in an independent test group, then given the amount of pressure that's already on the developers to deliver, it is so easy&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/agile-tester-or-quality-engineer-whos-to-say/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the developers to say, this isn't my problem anymore. Thank goodness we've got the professionals over here. It's their job to test." &lt;em&gt;(00:11:21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the article, Elisabeth Hendrickson gives advice on how to avoid or escape this spiral of decreasing quality and speed. There are four dials you can turn either up or down:&lt;/p&gt;
