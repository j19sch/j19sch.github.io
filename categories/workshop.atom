    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago I attended &lt;a href="http://www.workroom-productions.com/"&gt;James Lyndsay&lt;/a&gt;'s 'Getting a Grip on Exploratory Testing' workshop in Amsterdam. So it's about time to write something about it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now one of the things I dislike about workshop blog posts is that people will say "It was great! And person X is such a good trainer!" without saying much about the content of the workshop. However, I find myself now writing this post and thinking: I shouldn't post a full summary of the workshop. Not that it would spoil too much for any future attendee: most of the workshop consists of exercises and discussion. But posting a summary of the workshop that James has put a lot of effort in to create, just doesn't feel right. So let me just say this: the workshop was great and James is such a good trainer! :-D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that's out of the way, there are a few things from the workshop I'd like to share. Of course, the usual disclaimer applies: these are my thoughts on what was presented during the workshop. Any misrepresentations are my responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
