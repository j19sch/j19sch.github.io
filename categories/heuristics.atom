    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing types in software testing are a mess. It's not just &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2016/regression-testing-it-means-less-than-you-think/"&gt;"regression testing"&lt;/a&gt; that can mean more things than there are people in the room. It's true for basically all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last week a teammate said &lt;em&gt;"We should also do integration testing."&lt;/em&gt; So I asked &lt;em&gt;"What do you mean by integration testing?"&lt;/em&gt;. And the reply was: &lt;em&gt;"Testing the frontend and backend together using Playwright."&lt;/em&gt; Which made me think &lt;em&gt;"I see what you mean, but I would never call that integration testing."&lt;/em&gt; and made me reply: &lt;em&gt;"Yeah, we should."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical solution to this problem is to start defining the different testing types. To me, that's just one approach of many to make sense of testing types. So far I've come up with an additional five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaboration&lt;/li&gt;

That changes with this post. I will provide a brief description for each of the five areas. I'll share some ideas how a list of the five areas of Agile might be useful. And I'll reflect on the question: Are they the five areas of good software development or of Agile software development?&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I realized there are a few testing questions I use a lot. They lie at the top of my testing toolbox, so to speak. Together they shape my testing style, making it easier for me to discover certain things, but probably also harder to find other kinds of things. So here are my five favorite testing questions, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if there are zero, one, many, lots of this thing?&lt;a id="zero-ony-many-lots-oops"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I expressed my surprise &lt;a href="https://chaos.social/@joeposaurus/109427704814392787"&gt;on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; how many times I've found bugs by asking the question: &lt;em&gt;"What if there are 0 / 1 / several / lots of this thing?"&lt;/em&gt; And if you're working closely enough to the code, you should also ask about "null".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few people responded to my message. Turns out it's a &lt;a href="https://www.qwan.eu/2021/07/09/tdd-0-1-n.html"&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.wingman-sw.com/tdd-guided-by-zombies"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mas.to/@zebulon/109428667658139893"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; in TDD. And Brian Marick&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/my-five-favorite-testing-questions/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; remembered it &lt;a href="https://mstdn.social/@marick/109428042023981110"&gt;standing out&lt;/a&gt; when he was looking into fixed bugs in the Linux kernel they used in the '80s. Personally I learned it from Elisabeth Hendrickson's &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150217124452/http://testobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/testheuristicscheatsheetv1.pdf"&gt;"Test Heuristics Cheat Sheet"&lt;/a&gt;, which found a &lt;a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/articles/ab1cd85c?s_id=14715206"&gt;new home&lt;/a&gt; last year at the Ministry of Testing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>From tension to agreement with Sociocracy 3.0</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I started my new job at a small consultancy. During my onboarding I noticed something that I thought could be improved. So I figured I should come up with a proposal to address that. It also made me wonder how me proposing this improvement would go over with my new colleagues. And then I remembered I learned about a good way of doing this in a workshop&lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/from-tension-to-agreement-with-sociocracy-30/#fn:6"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at the 2016 &lt;a href="https://xpdaysbenelux.nl/"&gt;XP Days Benelux&lt;/a&gt; conference. That workshop was about &lt;a href="https://sociocracy30.org/"&gt;Sociocracy 3.0&lt;/a&gt; (S3 for short). So I ended up proposing two things in the meeting: my improvement, but also a way to come to an agreement about my proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactions to my proposal about how to come to agreements, were mostly positive. One person asked a very good question though: &lt;em&gt;"Is this solving a problem we are having? Or is this a solution looking for a problem? What would be the reasons for adopting this?"&lt;/em&gt; In response I expanded on my reasons for wanting this and we decided to give it a try. My dual proposal helped here: let's try the S3 patterns I shared on the improvement I proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I'm happy with my reply to those questions and I also feel I can do better. Which makes this the perfect opportunity for my first blog post of 2022. I'll start with a brief introduction on Sociocracy 3.0, then I'll share the proposal I made based on S3, and finally I'll talk about why I like this form of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It's time to retire our test case management tools</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the topic of test case management tools popped up a few times in my surroundings. In almost all cases I'd recommend against using these kinds of tools and I found myself able to give a few reasons, but also found that my thoughts lacked the clarity I'd like them to have. Hence this blog post, to force myself to think more deeply and communicate more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into that, there are a few things this blog post is not about. I won't be really going into what effect test cases have on test execution, or rather if test cases are a good tool to use when doing actual testing. Personally I don't think they are and I wrote about my inability to use them in &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2013/test-cases-cant-do-m-no-more/"&gt;this post from July 2013&lt;/a&gt;. For some deeper thoughts on this, I recommend James Bach's and Aaron Hodder's article "&lt;a href="https://www.testingcircus.com/documents/TestingTrapeze-2014-February.pdf#page=31"&gt;Test cases are not testing: Towards a culture of test performance&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do want to cover in this post is managing test cases. Having a collection of test cases stored somewhere to re-use across releases and reporting their pass/fail numbers. Both are important use cases for a test case management tool and both are in my opinion a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long time ago (March 2015) I wrote a post titled "&lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2015/test-automation-five-questions-leading-to-five-heuristics/"&gt;Test automation - five questions leading to five heuristics&lt;/a&gt;". Later that year &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richrtesting"&gt;Rich Rogers&lt;/a&gt; asked for a follow-up. To which I replied I should do a follow-up post (ahum) "soon".
Then last Wednesday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noahsussman"&gt;Noah Sussman&lt;/a&gt; said on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noahsussman/status/1136288062651142149"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;'I don't know that I've *ever* seen "this is how testers write code"'&lt;/em&gt;. To which I replied "challenge accepted", so now here we are, me writing a blog post about how I as a tester write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of this post turned out to be advice based on my experiences, so the usual disclaimers apply. And feel free to leave a comment if you have any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;use an IDE&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IDE is not just an advanced text editor. It understands your code - to a degree, since it's not interpreting, compiling or executing the code. So not only allows an IDE you to manipulate your code as text, it also allows you to manipulate your code as code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2019/how-this-tester-writes-code/"&gt;follow-up&lt;/a&gt; to this post in June 2019 in which I &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2019/how-this-tester-writes-code/#revisiting-my-blogpost-from-2105"&gt;revisit the heuristics&lt;/a&gt; from this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984 Abelson and Sussman said in the Preface to '&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"&gt;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt;':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. &lt;strong&gt;Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&lt;/strong&gt; Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems. [emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This oft-quoted sentence I emphasized, is even more true if the purpose of our programs is test automation&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2015/test-automation-five-questions-leading-to-five-heuristics/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So let's say you run your test automation program and the result is a list of passes and fails.  The purpose of testing is to produce information. You could say that this list of results qualifies as information and I would disagree. I would say it is data, data in need of interpretation. When we attempt this interpretation, we should consider the following five questions.&lt;/p&gt;
