    <summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://smallsheds.garden/images/2023/note-taking-system/notebook-and-pen.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started working back in 2006, I've used a notebook. Initially, I didn't have a system, I just wrote things down. Then, about seven years ago, when I became a scrum master, my notebook became more important. As a tester, I could use my team's board to keep track of my work. As a scrum master, none of my work was on the board. And even though my role has changed several times since then, my need for keeping track of things hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So somewhere along the way - and to be honest I forgot when exactly - I created my own system of note-taking based on bullet journaling. It's simple and straightforward. It helps me plan my day, list possible future actions, and keep a record of what I've been doing. On the one hand it seems like something small and simple. On the other hand it has been a major help to me, so I figured it's worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
