    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, going to try to keep this short and ranty (rantish?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical test advice is to do a Product Risk Analysis (PRA, mind the capitalisation!) and based on that you decide what to test and how thoroughly. The most common way to do a PRA is with a workshop. Put some people in a room with a lot of stickies, let them list all the risks they can think of and then have them score them. Et voilà, Product Risk Analysis is done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't really make sense, now does it? If someone were to give you an object and asked you "What could possibly go wrong with this?", what would you do? Gather a bunch of people with some knowledge of the object, yet no actual experience with it and do a workshop imagining things that could go wrong? That's not an Analysis (capital A!), that's a SWAG – a scientific wild ass guess.&lt;/p&gt;
