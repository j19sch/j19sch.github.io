    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the topic of test case management tools popped up a few times in my surroundings. In almost all cases I'd recommend against using these kinds of tools and I found myself able to give a few reasons, but also found that my thoughts lacked the clarity I'd like them to have. Hence this blog post, to force myself to think more deeply and communicate more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into that, there are a few things this blog post is not about. I won't be really going into what effect test cases have on test execution, or rather if test cases are a good tool to use when doing actual testing. Personally I don't think they are and I wrote about my inability to use them in &lt;a href="https://j19sch.github.io/blog/2013/test-cases-cant-do-m-no-more/"&gt;this post from July 2013&lt;/a&gt;. For some deeper thoughts on this, I recommend James Bach's and Aaron Hodder's article "&lt;a href="https://www.testingcircus.com/documents/TestingTrapeze-2014-February.pdf#page=31"&gt;Test cases are not testing: Towards a culture of test performance&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do want to cover in this post is managing test cases. Having a collection of test cases stored somewhere to re-use across releases and reporting their pass/fail numbers. Both are important use cases for a test case management tool and both are in my opinion a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I originally wrote this primer to share with people at work. The first section is intended to be generally applicable; the second not necessarily so. The main influences on this primer are:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Rapid Software Testing's &lt;a href="https://www.satisfice.com/tools/htsm.pdf"&gt;Heuristic Test Strategy Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- James Lyndsay's &lt;a href="http://www.workroom-productions.com/papers/Exploration%20and%20Strategy.pdf"&gt;Why Exploration has a place in any Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Rikard Edgren's &lt;a href="http://www.thetesteye.com/papers/TheLittleBlackBookOnTestDesign.pdf"&gt;Little Black Book on Test Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document contains two sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why have a test strategy? - what is a test strategy and what's its purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test strategy checklist - checklist for describing your test strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why have a test strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a test strategy is to answer the question: "How do we know that what we are building, is good enough?" As such, every team has a test strategy, even if it's only implicitly defined through the actions of the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regression testing, it means less than you think</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past weeks I have made several attempts at a blog post about regression testing. About how we use it to refer to different things: tests running on a CI server, people executing test scripts, etc. And about how often the term really doesn't mean much at all, yet nobody questions you when you use it: "What are you doing?" "Regression testing." "Oh good, carry on." The point of the post would be to argue we should use the term 'regression testing' a lot less, because most of the time we can be more specific without having to be more verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the more I thought about (what I would qualify as) proper regression testing, the more I felt that regression versus progression (or progressive) testing is a distinction without difference. One interesting observation in this regard is that "regression testing" returns 30 times more results on Google than "progression testing" and "progressive testing" combined. So what's going on here if we have a dichotomy with one member producing so much more discussion than the other? And there's more: regression testing is commonly contrasted with test types like functional testing and usability testing. But how then should I categorize a regression test focusing on functionality&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://j19sch.github.io/blog/2016/regression-testing-it-means-less-than-you-think/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joining the fray on ISO 29119</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who weren't aware yet: something happened at CAST 2014 regarding the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Software Testing. For instance, first &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A721ltyVw3o&amp;amp;list=PLQB4l9iafcelXpJnK6IyDsoFeEb1icqrl"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; happened, which resulted in &lt;a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/stop29119"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.professionaltestersmanifesto.org/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and a whole bunch of other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then someone on twitter (forgot who, apologies) suggested watching Stuard Reid's Eurostar webinar "ISO 29119 – the new set of international standards on software testing" which can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4W-jWRldj0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Since I liked to learn more about the standard, but not enough to pay almost 500€ to &lt;a href="http://www.nen.nl/Zoekresultaten.htm?q=iso+29119"&gt;NEN&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch standards organisation) for parts 1 to 3, I began watching the webinar.
And truth be told, I didn't watch all of it. Some parts were boring, some parts sounded quite reasonable and some parts I..euh..skipped. And that's ok because all I want to discuss is this one particular quote that begins at 33:25:&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defect severity 'Skynet': If this gets to production, we're screwed. Really screwed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with templates is that the people who need them shouldn't be writing the document in the first place and that the people who don't need them, have trouble shaking off the vague sense of obligation to adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy path application: application that works perfectly fine as long as you stick to the beaten path with your eyes half-closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of a test plan can be divided into the following four categories: good stuff, cover your ass, bullshit, trivialities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhist software development: there is no progress, only a never-ending cycle of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I am enjoying these short, not very nuanced, not extremely well thought out blog posts, here’s another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think that it makes sense to think of testing as a project within a project, so they apply project management tools and techniques to testing. This simply doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because what are the tools and techniques do they use? A plan with milestones no one is ever going to make as unexpected stuff tends to happen. A budget that is too tight because it’s based on that same plan. Entry criteria that are not met, but never mind, we’re running out of time so you need to start testing anyhow. And finally exit criteria that we fail to meet as well, but hey we’ll go live anyway, because the software really isn’t that bad (or so we hope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end, a lot of time and effort is spent on producing documents that are of little use in guiding the actual testing effort. The only thing they do is give some people a warm and fuzzy illusion of control.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing the style of my previous blog post...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days ago I found myself no longer able to think in test cases while testing. Of course, it's not as if I was using test design techniques to generate test cases one day and woke up the next day to find myself unable to do it anymore. But still, about a week ago I figured I had explored enough to be able to write down the test cases I wanted to execute and found myself staring at a blank page (well ok, empty Excel sheet) feeling alienated from what I was planning to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I mean when saying "thinking in test cases". Simply put, you take a piece of functionality, let a test design technique loose on it and there you go: a set of test cases to execute. Combine test design techniques over the different pieces of functionality as required and you're all covered test strategy-wise. Or that's the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why your Product Risk Analysis isn't</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, going to try to keep this short and ranty (rantish?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical test advice is to do a Product Risk Analysis (PRA, mind the capitalisation!) and based on that you decide what to test and how thoroughly. The most common way to do a PRA is with a workshop. Put some people in a room with a lot of stickies, let them list all the risks they can think of and then have them score them. Et voilà, Product Risk Analysis is done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't really make sense, now does it? If someone were to give you an object and asked you "What could possibly go wrong with this?", what would you do? Gather a bunch of people with some knowledge of the object, yet no actual experience with it and do a workshop imagining things that could go wrong? That's not an Analysis (capital A!), that's a SWAG – a scientific wild ass guess.&lt;/p&gt;
