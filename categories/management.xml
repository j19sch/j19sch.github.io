More specifically, how essential are testers to the team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there are basically three options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do not add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not clear if your testers add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;Your testers do not add something essential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is becoming more and more common. Thanks to Agile, CI/CD, DevOps, improved tooling and changing expectations, you should not have testers that find the dumb bugs I was expected to find at the start of my career. If a programmer wrote a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where it should have been a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, we should expect a unit test and not a tester to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

There are good reasons not to estimate at all. Work in thin slices, keep cycle time low, and deliver at steady pace. And yet, it's still fair of others to ask: when will this big chunk of work be done? And not "maybe done", but "definitely-I-can-promise-this-to-people done".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you can calculate an expected delivery date based on your current pace and the number of slices in the new big chunk of work. But maybe you don't have the slices yet. Or it's a new kind of work and your current pace won't really apply. Or there are upcoming changes in your team or organization that make any calculation tenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have to provide an estimate. And you do. You say &lt;em&gt;"six months"&lt;/em&gt;. And the other person - from sales or marketing or some engineering director - says: &lt;em&gt;"We need it in three."&lt;/em&gt; What just happened is that you estimated in something that's not negotiable. In time, in this case. And the end result is that everyone is unhappy. You have other options, though. You can negotiate in something else than time.&lt;/p&gt;

We keep trying different permutations: shifting left and shifting right, being closer to the programmers while not too far from other testers, doing less testing ourselves so we can support others more, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, to be effective in any of these permutations, you can't let yourself be limited by them. You need to work both inside and outside the existing structures. You have to "be all over the place", in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testers do testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a straightforward statement: a tester tests. Then what is testing? I &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2018/reflections-on-my-testing-manifesto/"&gt;still like&lt;/a&gt; the definition &lt;em&gt;"Testing is investigating in order to evaluate a product."&lt;/em&gt; The most obvious thing to investigate, to test, is the code that is being written. The best way to do this, in my opinion, is through the combination of exploratory testing and test automation, i.e. what &lt;a href="https://maaretp.com/"&gt;Maaret Pyhäjärvi&lt;/a&gt; has named "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_67oQrPZhQ"&gt;contemporary exploratory testing&lt;/a&gt;". And to be clear, while the execution part tends to be the most visible, effective testing also needs good test strategy, design, and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

At one point I said something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum masters often end up as scrum mascots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maaret said I should write a blog post about scrum mascots&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/scrum-master-or-scrum-mascot/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master"&gt;2020 Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; a Scrum Master&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/scrum-master-or-scrum-mascot/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is accountable for two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;"establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;"the Scrum Team's effectiveness"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability implies (or rather: should imply) corresponding authority. You're being held accountable for certain outcomes *and* you have sufficient power to influence those outcomes. That's a scrum master. A scrum mascot is a very different beast: they have neither power nor accountability. And yet that seems to be what a lot of organizations (and scrum masters?) want.&lt;/p&gt;

What is it exactly that they do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made this question even more pertinent to me (apart from the job applications) is that in the past I have been a scrum master. But that was five years ago and none of my jobs since had much involvement of a scrum master. And my experiences of those past five years made me wonder: where exactly does a scrum master fit in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A scrum master is the Scrum boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master"&gt;The 2020 Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It covers my first six months at a scale-up, working as a quality engineer for the first time - after having worked in other testing-related roles for 15+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main finding is that for a quality engineering role to work well, certain structures need to be in place. The most important one is that the impact the quality engineer is expected to have, is clear to both the quality engineer and the team(s) they are supporting. However, regardless of which structures you put in place, a quality engineer will also need to work around those structures to be fully effective.&lt;/p&gt;

What struck me most about the post was the amount of work the word "tester" was doing. In one sentence it meant one thing (a role in a team), in the next sentence something else (a step in the process), and so on. Hence the title of this post: the word "tester" was being used as an overloaded variable. So let's do some unpacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testers to people management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Having a tester"&lt;/em&gt; means that there are people with the official title of "tester" or "QA engineer" or whatever within the company. For the purposes of people management&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/tester-is-an-overloaded-variable/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, there's a distinction between this role and the other roles in the company. This allows for more specific expectations about the role, for different career paths and salary scales, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alanpage"&gt;Alan Page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unremarkableQA"&gt;Areti Panou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/northern_tester"&gt;Ash Winter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btknaack"&gt;Bart Knaack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conorfi"&gt;Conor Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roukedejong"&gt;Rouke de Jong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gwendiagram"&gt;Gwen Diagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie"&gt;George Dinwiddie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/janetgregoryca"&gt;Janet Gregory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joost_voskuil"&gt;Joost Voskuil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jpjwolli"&gt;Joost van Wollingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmeijeri"&gt;Martijn Meijering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robmeaney"&gt;Rob Meaney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinwijnl"&gt;Vincent Wijnen&lt;/a&gt; - with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/huibschoots"&gt;Huib Schoots&lt;/a&gt; facilitating the peer conference. The main topics mentioned in the invite were: "How can you sell quality?", "How can you convince people that quality can accelerate software delivery?", and "What limitations or barriers do you hit?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting during and after our discussions on these topics, I realized there are some interesting things going on about how we talk about quality and how to sell it. Enough interesting things to fill more than one blog post, so this will be a four-part series. And I might expand on some ideas in the series after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third part, exploring five different management paradigms as identified by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carolsanford"&gt;Carol Sanford&lt;/a&gt; in her book "&lt;a href="https://carolsanford.com/the-regenerative-business/"&gt;The Regenerative Business&lt;/a&gt;" and how they affect quality. The first part was about choosing your value system can be found &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/choosing-your-value-system/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The second part about selling quality can be found &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/who-doesnt-want-quality/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Psychological cover and psychological safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the challenge of quality is getting several things right (perception, desire, and means) and getting to an agreement among people, how we organize ourselves becomes a crucial topic. As W. Edwards Deming said: "A bad system will beat a good person every time." Or as Kurt Lewin said in a more neutral way: "Behavior is a function of the Person and the Environment." An important part of any environment is psychological safety. In &lt;a href="https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/blog/we're-the-aliens-three-ways-to-seek-safety/"&gt;episode 155&lt;/a&gt; of their &lt;a href="https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/troubleshooting-agile-podcast/"&gt;Troubleshooting Agile&lt;/a&gt; podcast &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jtf"&gt;Jeffrey Fredrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel"&gt;Douglas Squirrel&lt;/a&gt; make an interesting distinction between psychological cover and psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;
