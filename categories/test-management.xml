My first thought was: &lt;em&gt;"I have close to two decades of experience in testing. I got this!"&lt;/em&gt; My second thought was: &lt;em&gt;"I haven't written a release advice in over ten years, how do I do this again?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the first thought reflected reality a lot better than the second one. And after reviews by my team members, my project lead, and our manager, I'm proud of the end result. Even though in some ways the document has ended up more like a release decision, than a release advice. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;Lead with the actual advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was going to start the document with a management summary, then an introduction, an overview of the testing that was done, the relevant known issues and remaining risks, then the actual release advice and finally some ideas on how to improve our testing further. Quite soon I realized that didn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

It's not just &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2016/regression-testing-it-means-less-than-you-think/"&gt;"regression testing"&lt;/a&gt; that can mean more things than there are people in the room. It's true for basically all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last week a teammate said &lt;em&gt;"We should also do integration testing."&lt;/em&gt; So I asked &lt;em&gt;"What do you mean by integration testing?"&lt;/em&gt;. And the reply was: &lt;em&gt;"Testing the frontend and backend together using Playwright."&lt;/em&gt; Which made me think &lt;em&gt;"I see what you mean, but I would never call that integration testing."&lt;/em&gt; and made me reply: &lt;em&gt;"Yeah, we should."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical solution to this problem is to start defining the different testing types. To me, that's just one approach of many to make sense of testing types. So far I've come up with an additional five.&lt;/p&gt;

More specifically, how essential are testers to the team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there are basically three options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do not add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not clear if your testers add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;Your testers do not add something essential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is becoming more and more common. Thanks to Agile, CI/CD, DevOps, improved tooling and changing expectations, you should not have testers that find the dumb bugs I was expected to find at the start of my career. If a programmer wrote a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where it should have been a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, we should expect a unit test and not a tester to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

We keep trying different permutations: shifting left and shifting right, being closer to the programmers while not too far from other testers, doing less testing ourselves so we can support others more, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, to be effective in any of these permutations, you can't let yourself be limited by them. You need to work both inside and outside the existing structures. You have to "be all over the place", in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testers do testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a straightforward statement: a tester tests. Then what is testing? I &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2018/reflections-on-my-testing-manifesto/"&gt;still like&lt;/a&gt; the definition &lt;em&gt;"Testing is investigating in order to evaluate a product."&lt;/em&gt; The most obvious thing to investigate, to test, is the code that is being written. The best way to do this, in my opinion, is through the combination of exploratory testing and test automation, i.e. what &lt;a href="https://maaretp.com/"&gt;Maaret Pyhäjärvi&lt;/a&gt; has named "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_67oQrPZhQ"&gt;contemporary exploratory testing&lt;/a&gt;". And to be clear, while the execution part tends to be the most visible, effective testing also needs good test strategy, design, and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

What struck me most about the post was the amount of work the word "tester" was doing. In one sentence it meant one thing (a role in a team), in the next sentence something else (a step in the process), and so on. Hence the title of this post: the word "tester" was being used as an overloaded variable. So let's do some unpacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testers to people management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Having a tester"&lt;/em&gt; means that there are people with the official title of "tester" or "QA engineer" or whatever within the company. For the purposes of people management&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/tester-is-an-overloaded-variable/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, there's a distinction between this role and the other roles in the company. This allows for more specific expectations about the role, for different career paths and salary scales, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

This post collects three thoughts on risk-based testing I kept returning to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If not based on risks, then based on what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1533760354647523330"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the alternatives to risk-based testing?&lt;br&gt;
Requirements-based? I'd argue that's a subset of risk-based.&lt;br&gt;
Unguided? That's either a bad idea ("we hope to get lucky") or aimed at the risk of unknown unknowns.&lt;br&gt;
Any other options? Because something about the term is bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My question was inspired by the &lt;a href="https://slides.smallsheds.garden/rtc2019-testing-types.html#/15/0/1"&gt;"opposite" heuristic&lt;/a&gt; from my talk about &lt;a href="https://slides.smallsheds.garden/rtc2019-testing-types.html#/"&gt;testing types&lt;/a&gt;: if we have some kind of category, what's the name for the things not in that category? Applied to risk-based testing: what's the name for testing that's not risk-based?&lt;/p&gt;

In almost all cases I'd recommend against using these kinds of tools and I found myself able to give a few reasons, but also found that my thoughts lacked the clarity I'd like them to have. Hence this blog post, to force myself to think more deeply and communicate more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into that, there are a few things this blog post is not about. I won't be really going into what effect test cases have on test execution, or rather if test cases are a good tool to use when doing actual testing. Personally I don't think they are and I wrote about my inability to use them in &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2013/test-cases-cant-do-m-no-more/"&gt;this post from July 2013&lt;/a&gt;. For some deeper thoughts on this, I recommend James Bach's and Aaron Hodder's article "&lt;a href="https://www.testingcircus.com/documents/TestingTrapeze-2014-February.pdf#page=31"&gt;Test cases are not testing: Towards a culture of test performance&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do want to cover in this post is managing test cases. Having a collection of test cases stored somewhere to re-use across releases and reporting their pass/fail numbers. Both are important use cases for a test case management tool and both are in my opinion a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

The first section is intended to be generally applicable; the second not necessarily so. The main influences on this primer are:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Rapid Software Testing's &lt;a href="https://www.satisfice.com/tools/htsm.pdf"&gt;Heuristic Test Strategy Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- James Lyndsay's &lt;a href="http://www.workroom-productions.com/papers/Exploration%20and%20Strategy.pdf"&gt;Why Exploration has a place in any Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Rikard Edgren's &lt;a href="http://www.thetesteye.com/papers/TheLittleBlackBookOnTestDesign.pdf"&gt;Little Black Book on Test Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document contains two sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why have a test strategy? - what is a test strategy and what's its purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test strategy checklist - checklist for describing your test strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why have a test strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a test strategy is to answer the question: "How do we know that what we are building, is good enough?" As such, every team has a test strategy, even if it's only implicitly defined through the actions of the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

About how we use it to refer to different things: tests running on a CI server, people executing test scripts, etc. And about how often the term really doesn't mean much at all, yet nobody questions you when you use it: "What are you doing?" "Regression testing." "Oh good, carry on." The point of the post would be to argue we should use the term 'regression testing' a lot less, because most of the time we can be more specific without having to be more verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the more I thought about (what I would qualify as) proper regression testing, the more I felt that regression versus progression (or progressive) testing is a distinction without difference. One interesting observation in this regard is that "regression testing" returns 30 times more results on Google than "progression testing" and "progressive testing" combined. So what's going on here if we have a dichotomy with one member producing so much more discussion than the other? And there's more: regression testing is commonly contrasted with test types like functional testing and usability testing. But how then should I categorize a regression test focusing on functionality&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2016/regression-testing-it-means-less-than-you-think/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, first &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A721ltyVw3o&amp;amp;list=PLQB4l9iafcelXpJnK6IyDsoFeEb1icqrl"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; happened, which resulted in &lt;a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/stop29119"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.professionaltestersmanifesto.org/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and a whole bunch of other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then someone on twitter (forgot who, apologies) suggested watching Stuard Reid's Eurostar webinar "ISO 29119 – the new set of international standards on software testing" which can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4W-jWRldj0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Since I liked to learn more about the standard, but not enough to pay almost 500€ to &lt;a href="http://www.nen.nl/Zoekresultaten.htm?q=iso+29119"&gt;NEN&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch standards organisation) for parts 1 to 3, I began watching the webinar.
And truth be told, I didn't watch all of it. Some parts were boring, some parts sounded quite reasonable and some parts I..euh..skipped. And that's ok because all I want to discuss is this one particular quote that begins at 33:25:&lt;/p&gt;
