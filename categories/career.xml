&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do not all have the same job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent episode of the &lt;a href="https://qualityremarks.com/qr-podcast/"&gt;Quality Remarks podcast&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Keith Klain, Paul Holland told the story of an organization where running the test automation took 13 people two weeks. And no, I'm sorry, they didn't go into any detail about what happened in those two weeks. In my current project our pipeline takes 0 people about 17 minutes to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do not all have the same job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

More specifically, how essential are testers to the team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there are basically three options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do not add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not clear if your testers add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;Your testers do not add something essential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is becoming more and more common. Thanks to Agile, CI/CD, DevOps, improved tooling and changing expectations, you should not have testers that find the dumb bugs I was expected to find at the start of my career. If a programmer wrote a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where it should have been a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, we should expect a unit test and not a tester to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

Back then, there was no test automation, we worked in the slow rhythm of waterfall, and for years I was in a team with other testers or at least had a test manager to bounce ideas off. These days, there's a good chance none of these are true as you start as a test engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of these changes are good ones (please don't take test automation or agile away), it does make me empathize with anyone who starts their career as a test engineer today. The pace is higher and the skill set is broader. More importantly, you need to navigate your career while no one is really sure where to position testers in their organization. That's not a straightforward environment to start a career in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are four pieces of advice I'd give myself if I'd start my career in testing today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;testing can be many different things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you're a software engineer that specializes in testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the end-game is leadership skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shape your career in a way that suits you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
