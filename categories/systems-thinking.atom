    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend the third Dutch Exploratory Workshop in Testing (DEWT3 for short) took place. The ingredients were: a very nice hotel in the woods, lots of talk about testing, beer, whiskey, a small to moderate amount of sleep, stickies and a group of fun and interesting people (You can see them &lt;a href="http://dewt.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/dewt3-experience-reports/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday the talks (and thus discussions) were about systems thinking. A few years ago I did read Jerry Weinberg's "An Introduction to General Systems Thinking" and although a very interesting read, w.r.t. to applying it to testing I never got further then: Software is (part of) a system, so you can apply systems thinking to it. Of course, that's very much true, but it's also quite a vague piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A primer on systems thinking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter James Bach, who kicked off DEWT3 with a primer on systems thinking. Systems thinking is just a way of thinking - just like logical thinking, analogical thinking, creative thinking, etc. - in which we approach a situation as being a system. So what's a system? It's a set of things in a meaningful interaction with each other.
This definition raises all sorts of questions relevant in systems thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
