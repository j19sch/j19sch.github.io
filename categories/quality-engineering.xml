We keep trying different permutations: shifting left and shifting right, being closer to the programmers while not too far from other testers, doing less testing ourselves so we can support others more, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, to be effective in any of these permutations, you can't let yourself be limited by them. You need to work both inside and outside the existing structures. You have to "be all over the place", in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testers do testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a straightforward statement: a tester tests. Then what is testing? I &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2018/reflections-on-my-testing-manifesto/"&gt;still like&lt;/a&gt; the definition &lt;em&gt;"Testing is investigating in order to evaluate a product."&lt;/em&gt; The most obvious thing to investigate, to test, is the code that is being written. The best way to do this, in my opinion, is through the combination of exploratory testing and test automation, i.e. what &lt;a href="https://maaretp.com/"&gt;Maaret Pyhäjärvi&lt;/a&gt; has named "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_67oQrPZhQ"&gt;contemporary exploratory testing&lt;/a&gt;". And to be clear, while the execution part tends to be the most visible, effective testing also needs good test strategy, design, and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

It covers my first six months at a scale-up, working as a quality engineer for the first time - after having worked in other testing-related roles for 15+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main finding is that for a quality engineering role to work well, certain structures need to be in place. The most important one is that the impact the quality engineer is expected to have, is clear to both the quality engineer and the team(s) they are supporting. However, regardless of which structures you put in place, a quality engineer will also need to work around those structures to be fully effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I write a blog post about companies leaving money on the table by not leveraging their choice of work management tool (Jira, Shortcut, etc) as a competitive advantage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31% said "yes" and 54% said "a post about what now?", which I suppose reflects my own feelings about the topic. And it motivated me to write this post - especially that 54%. So let's talk about work management tools, the original (user) stories, affordances and constraints, and how these tools are limiting our imagination. &lt;/p&gt;

So far it's been an interesting challenge. The two teams were formed only a few months before I joined, although some team members had been working for the company before that. Each team has their own product manager. We also have an engineering manager, but he joined only two weeks before I did. And then I was added to the mix, with a job description that didn't give a lot more guidance than: support the team in things related to testing and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my first task in my new job was figuring out what my job was. Or rather, figure out what concrete things I could do that fit that job description. This was not made easier by the fact that we're a fully remote company. Not being in the same space throughout the day does make things harder when you're trying to find your place. Reflecting on the past three months made me realize there are three things that are really important: visibility, connections, and patience.&lt;/p&gt;

She discovered that beyond a certain point, investigating more in independent testing will make both quality and speed go down, not up. In &lt;a href="https://itrevolution.com/podcast/the-idealcast-episode-3/"&gt;episode 3&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://itrevolution.com/podcast/"&gt;Idealcast&lt;/a&gt;, she summarizes her article as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[...] when you ramp up the amount of investment in an independent test group, then given the amount of pressure that's already on the developers to deliver, it is so easy&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/agile-tester-or-quality-engineer-whos-to-say/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the developers to say, this isn't my problem anymore. Thank goodness we've got the professionals over here. It's their job to test." &lt;em&gt;(00:11:21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the article, Elisabeth Hendrickson gives advice on how to avoid or escape this spiral of decreasing quality and speed. There are four dials you can turn either up or down:&lt;/p&gt;

Not too long ago I used that definition in the &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/choosing-your-value-system/"&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; of my four-part series "Thinking about quality". However, in the &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/thinking-about-quality-so-what-to-do/"&gt;fourth post&lt;/a&gt; of that series I also said that quality is something emergent. And I continued with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can have long discussions about what quality is, but that's a different question from how do you get quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I took this one step further, when I realized that depending on the context, I talk very differently about quality. And while I may not define 'quality' explicitly in every conversation, implicitly I'm still using different definitions. That alone, I think is interesting: instead of a single, general definition of quality that always applies, I have different definitions depending on their purpose&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2022/quality-different-purposes-different-definitions/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alanpage"&gt;Alan Page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unremarkableQA"&gt;Areti Panou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/northern_tester"&gt;Ash Winter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btknaack"&gt;Bart Knaack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conorfi"&gt;Conor Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roukedejong"&gt;Rouke de Jong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gwendiagram"&gt;Gwen Diagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie"&gt;George Dinwiddie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/janetgregoryca"&gt;Janet Gregory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joost_voskuil"&gt;Joost Voskuil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jpjwolli"&gt;Joost van Wollingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmeijeri"&gt;Martijn Meijering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robmeaney"&gt;Rob Meaney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinwijnl"&gt;Vincent Wijnen&lt;/a&gt; - with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/huibschoots"&gt;Huib Schoots&lt;/a&gt; facilitating the peer conference. The main topics mentioned in the invite were: "How can you sell quality?", "How can you convince people that quality can accelerate software delivery?", and "What limitations or barriers do you hit?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting during and after our discussions on these topics, I realized there are some interesting things going on about how we talk about quality and how to sell it. Enough interesting things to fill more than one blog post, so this will be a four-part series. And I might expand on some ideas in the series after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three parts covered rather philosophical topics: &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/choosing-your-value-system/"&gt;choosing your value system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/who-doesnt-want-quality/"&gt;exploring what it means to sell quality&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/management-paradigms-and-quality/"&gt;how management paradigms affect quality&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the third post I brought up the main question for this fourth and last post: so now what? If you expect me to get very concrete and specific in this post, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. What I will do, is share a way to think about actions that has been helpful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality is something emergent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charrett"&gt;Anne-Marie Charrett&lt;/a&gt; says in a blog post titled "&lt;a href="https://mavericktester.com/2018/12/04/emergent-quality/"&gt;Emergent Quality&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My hypothesis is that quality is an emergent behaviour. It relies on a whole set of independent systems coming together to create this emergent property. We can never truly know what quality is. It’s constantly changing and morphing into different things. For sure, we can provide examples, but know quality itself? I’m not convinced."&lt;/p&gt;

Enough interesting things to fill more than one blog post, so this will be a four-part series. And I might expand on some ideas in the series after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third part, exploring five different management paradigms as identified by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carolsanford"&gt;Carol Sanford&lt;/a&gt; in her book "&lt;a href="https://carolsanford.com/the-regenerative-business/"&gt;The Regenerative Business&lt;/a&gt;" and how they affect quality. The first part was about choosing your value system can be found &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/choosing-your-value-system/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The second part about selling quality can be found &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/who-doesnt-want-quality/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Psychological cover and psychological safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the challenge of quality is getting several things right (perception, desire, and means) and getting to an agreement among people, how we organize ourselves becomes a crucial topic. As W. Edwards Deming said: "A bad system will beat a good person every time." Or as Kurt Lewin said in a more neutral way: "Behavior is a function of the Person and the Environment." An important part of any environment is psychological safety. In &lt;a href="https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/blog/we're-the-aliens-three-ways-to-seek-safety/"&gt;episode 155&lt;/a&gt; of their &lt;a href="https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/troubleshooting-agile-podcast/"&gt;Troubleshooting Agile&lt;/a&gt; podcast &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jtf"&gt;Jeffrey Fredrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel"&gt;Douglas Squirrel&lt;/a&gt; make an interesting distinction between psychological cover and psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Everyone wants quality, right?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous post I distinguished two definitions of quality. If we proceed with the second and more interesting one, value to a person who matters, I would argue that everyone wants quality and is already doing their best to get it. The alternative would be that some people are not doing their best to get the things they value - which seems absurd to me.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alanpage"&gt;Alan Page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unremarkableQA"&gt;Areti Panou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/northern_tester"&gt;Ash Winter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/btknaack"&gt;Bart Knaack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conorfi"&gt;Conor Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roukedejong"&gt;Rouke de Jong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gwendiagram"&gt;Gwen Diagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie"&gt;George Dinwiddie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/janetgregoryca"&gt;Janet Gregory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joost_voskuil"&gt;Joost Voskuil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jpjwolli"&gt;Joost van Wollingen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmeijeri"&gt;Martijn Meijering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robmeaney"&gt;Rob Meaney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vinwijnl"&gt;Vincent Wijnen&lt;/a&gt; - with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/huibschoots"&gt;Huib Schoots&lt;/a&gt; facilitating the peer conference. The main topics mentioned in the invite were: "How can you sell quality?", "How can you convince people that quality can accelerate software delivery?", and "What limitations or barriers do you hit?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting during and after our discussions on these topics, I realized there are some interesting things going on about how we talk about quality and how to sell it. Enough interesting things to fill more than one blog post, so this will be a four-part series. And I might expand on some ideas in the series after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality has two different meanings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we use quality when we talk about things that are obviously better. A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3mB4MBITEI"&gt;$3500 coffee grinder&lt;/a&gt; is obviously better than &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYGxext8XI"&gt;a £50 one&lt;/a&gt;. An application that does not crash on you is obviously better than one that does. Almost all other ways to input your phone number are better than &lt;a href="https://qz.com/679782/programmers-imagine-the-most-ridiculous-ways-to-input-a-phone-number/"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
