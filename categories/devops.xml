&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a CI/CD pipeline is to allow you to deliver small changes in a fast and controlled way. Without any tests in your pipeline you would gain a lot of speed. You'd also lose a lot control, which is why people in general do run tests in their pipeline. The purpose of these tests is to check if that stage of the pipeline meets the minimum level of acceptable quality for that stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, commit stage tests will consist of mostly unit tests, a few integration tests, and even fewer end-to-end tests, because early in the pipeline speed is more important than comprehensiveness. When I commit my changes, I want the results fast enough so that I will wait for them - ready to fix any issue that might occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regression testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many definitions of regression testing, as you can read in &lt;a href="https://arborosa.org/2015/07/31/regression-testing/"&gt;Arborosa's blog post on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. I have always defined regression testing along the lines of "testing the parts that weren't impacted by a change to see if they really weren't impacted." (Which is really weird if you start thinking about it: something is regression testing depending on your knowledge of the system and the change.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The tests in your pipeline are regression tests, …&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the tests that run in your pipeline are regression tests. Your commits are small and you have a lot of tests, so most of those will cover parts of the system that shouldn't have been impacted by your changes. So yes, regression tests.&lt;/p&gt;
