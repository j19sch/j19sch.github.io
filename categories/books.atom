    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite books on leadership is "Extreme Ownership" by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. I can imagine some people bouncing off of the book because of the Navy SEAL angle, but to be honest I'm a bit of a sucker for the whole military leadership genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of "Extreme Ownership" covers four critical leadership concepts, the "Laws of Combat". Curiously enough, you can map these to the four values in the Agile Manifesto. These four concepts do come in a specific order, so you have to shuffle the Agile values around a little bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover and Move maps to customer collaboration over contract negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple maps to working software over comprehensive documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize and Execute maps to responding to change over following a plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralized Command maps to individuals and interactions over processes and tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me this mapping is interesting in two ways. It sheds a different light on the four Agile values. And it's an example of how I think we should be engaging with the Agile Manifesto, in a way that keeps it alive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Old-school Scrum was rad!</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, nine years before the first version of the Scrum Guide, Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle published &lt;em&gt;"Agile Software Development with Scrum"&lt;/em&gt;. This version of Scrum has some remarkable differences from even the &lt;a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/mitchlacey/image/upload/v1589750495/Scrum_Guide_v1_Scrum_Alliance_qe0y2w.pdf"&gt;first version of the Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three things that struck me most about this version of Scrum, were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrum Master is a management role, preferably by an engineer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no retrospective, impediments are addressed in the Daily Scrum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprints are 30 days and have a goal, tasks can be added and removed throughout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don't want to claim we should return to this old-school version of Scrum, I do appreciate how radical it is compared to how software development is done - even today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="https://agilecommshandbook.com/"&gt;"The agile comms handbook"&lt;/a&gt; I'm experimenting with a &lt;strong&gt;weekly (internal) blog&lt;/strong&gt;. No big promises on the content, just the things I feel like writing about at the end of my week. And as this is an experiment, things might change along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to add a &lt;strong&gt;comment, respond&lt;/strong&gt; to other people's comments and/or &lt;strong&gt;share&lt;/strong&gt; with others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I'll tell the story of my eight-month experiment with weekly notes. After that, I'll share some tips in case you want to give weekly notes a try too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Agile Manifesto is a poor introduction to Agile</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ezagroba"&gt;Elizabeth Zagroba&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ezagroba/status/1557608861690912772"&gt;asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone was completely new to working on software on an Agile team, what would you want them to read about Agile first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was: "The Agile Manifesto!" After a second thought, though, I reconsidered and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1557650105930579968"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would recommend against reading the Agile Manifesto without consulting any secondary sources, except if you read it in the same way as you would visit a historical site "just to see where it all happened".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote this, I could not really put my finger on why exactly I felt this way. The best I could come up with was that the Agile Manifesto is hard to understand on its own. You need some historical context and practical experience to make sense of it. Serendipity came to the rescue, though, as I'm currently reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing Like a State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott"&gt;James C. Scott&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 9 of the book focuses on the Greek concept of &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt; (μῆτις) and how it relates to rules of thumb. Turns out that this explains why the Agile Manifesto is a poor introduction to Agile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An approach to teaching Agile 20 years after the Agile Manifesto</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks I've been thinking about how I would teach Agile&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 2021, 20 years after the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; was published. After sharing my thoughts at &lt;a href="https://citconf.com/virtual2021/"&gt;CitCon Europe 2021 Virtual&lt;/a&gt; and having an interesting conversation about the state of Agile and how to teach it, I figured it's time to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I started thinking about this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Allan Kelly stated in a &lt;a href="https://www.allankellyassociates.co.uk/archives/2762/agile-won-the-war-but-lost-the-peace/"&gt;2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Agile won the war but lost the peace."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is doing Agile, even though very few people are living the dream promised by Agile. This makes it very difficult to use "Agile" as a label, as a name for something. When someone says "Agile", are they referring to what you're already doing or to something they think you should be doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html"&gt;written in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, based on what its authors were doing in the 1990s in response to the common ways of doing software development of that time. And since the Manifesto we've seen the introduction of Lean, of DevOps, and of CI/CD. So the amount of history that comes with Agile is large and it raises the question how much (if any) we should teach - especially since a lot of it is folklore instead of history&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Doing Agile's history justice would probably cost more time than makes sense if your goal is to teach people how to develop software in an Agile way&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And a lot of that history was a relatively long time ago, which is why I titled my CitCon session "Teaching Agile to people younger than the Manifesto".&lt;/p&gt;
