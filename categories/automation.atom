    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/workroomprds"&gt;James Lyndsay&lt;/a&gt; has created a number of amazing &lt;a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/"&gt;Black Box Puzzles&lt;/a&gt;: tiny applications that challenge you to figure out what they do. (You can support him in creating more of these at &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/workroomprds"&gt;his Patreon page&lt;/a&gt;.) Two of these Puzzles, &lt;a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/puzzle29/"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/puzzle31/"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;, not only have a GUI to explore, but also an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that gave me an idea. If you explore these Puzzles through their GUI, you start from the inputs. You try out different inputs in the hope of discovering a pattern in the outputs. And then that pattern feeds back into your exploration.&lt;br&gt;
With an API, however - and because of the nature of Puzzle 31 - it becomes easy to get the outputs for all possible combinations of inputs. Which means you can start your exploration from the outputs instead of the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I tell you how and what I did, three important remarks.&lt;br&gt;
First of all, I will be spoiling the solution to the Puzzle in this blog post. So this is the right moment to go and solve &lt;a href="http://blackboxpuzzles.workroomprds.com/puzzle31/"&gt;Puzzle 31&lt;/a&gt; for yourself first. Or at least go play a bit with it, so you have an idea what the inputs and outputs are.&lt;br&gt;
Secondly, I had already solved the Puzzle through the GUI a few months ago. So it was more of a "Can I find the solution this way as well?" than a "Can I find the solution?" thing.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, the code and the spreadsheet I created (linked throughout, also available on GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/j19sch/blackbox-puzzle-31"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), are not very clean. I thought about tidying them up, but my two reasons for not doing so are (1) laziness; (2) the way they are now gives a more honest picture of what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
