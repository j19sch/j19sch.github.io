At one point I said something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrum masters often end up as scrum mascots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maaret said I should write a blog post about scrum mascots&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/scrum-master-or-scrum-mascot/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master"&gt;2020 Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; a Scrum Master&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/scrum-master-or-scrum-mascot/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is accountable for two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;"establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;"the Scrum Team's effectiveness"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability implies (or rather: should imply) corresponding authority. You're being held accountable for certain outcomes *and* you have sufficient power to influence those outcomes. That's a scrum master. A scrum mascot is a very different beast: they have neither power nor accountability. And yet that seems to be what a lot of organizations (and scrum masters?) want.&lt;/p&gt;

What is it exactly that they do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made this question even more pertinent to me (apart from the job applications) is that in the past I have been a scrum master. But that was five years ago and none of my jobs since had much involvement of a scrum master. And my experiences of those past five years made me wonder: where exactly does a scrum master fit in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A scrum master is the Scrum boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master"&gt;The 2020 Scrum Guide&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We'll decide how we build it and how soon we'll deliver."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/a-backlog-item-is-a-backlog-item-is-a-backlog-item/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I've never seen that version of Scrum. The version I have seen, has a product manager try to get as many features into a sprint as reasonably possible - for varying degrees of reasonable. This comes at the expense of maintenance work, such as keeping libraries up-to-date or removing technical debt. And it incentivizes the team to cut corners on features, to not leave code in a better state than they found it, to not fix smaller bugs and instead log them somewhere for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution I see to this problem, is to put an engineering manager fully in charge of the team.&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/a-backlog-item-is-a-backlog-item-is-a-backlog-item/#fn:5"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The product manager prioritizes the features. The engineering manager prioritizes the full scope of work for the team. That's not a simple change to pull off, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution might be to change the way we use our backlogs. If a product manager gets to prioritize all the work, and the tool they use is a backlog, then we should make sure that all the work&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2023/a-backlog-item-is-a-backlog-item-is-a-backlog-item/#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is in the backlog: features, bugs, and technical debt. Let's take a look at each of these three categories of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I write a blog post about companies leaving money on the table by not leveraging their choice of work management tool (Jira, Shortcut, etc) as a competitive advantage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;31% said "yes" and 54% said "a post about what now?", which I suppose reflects my own feelings about the topic. And it motivated me to write this post - especially that 54%. So let's talk about work management tools, the original (user) stories, affordances and constraints, and how these tools are limiting our imagination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone was completely new to working on software on an Agile team, what would you want them to read about Agile first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was: "The Agile Manifesto!" After a second thought, though, I reconsidered and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1557650105930579968"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I would recommend against reading the Agile Manifesto without consulting any secondary sources, except if you read it in the same way as you would visit a historical site "just to see where it all happened".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote this, I could not really put my finger on why exactly I felt this way. The best I could come up with was that the Agile Manifesto is hard to understand on its own. You need some historical context and practical experience to make sense of it. Serendipity came to the rescue, though, as I'm currently reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing Like a State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott"&gt;James C. Scott&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 9 of the book focuses on the Greek concept of &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt; (μῆτις) and how it relates to rules of thumb. Turns out that this explains why the Agile Manifesto is a poor introduction to Agile.&lt;/p&gt;

My goal with the session was to uncover more Agile (micro-)skills. In this post I'll share what we did during the session and I'll close off with some thoughts on the biggest challenge of this exercise: too many skills. Before I start however, a big thank you to everyone who participated in the session!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the session with asking people to add stickies to the board of things they valued in Agile software development. When was I preparing the Miro board before the session, I labeled this part of the board "values". Then I remembered I had decided earlier to label it "what we value", so as to avoid the discussion about what values are and aren't. The topic did come up (i.e. the relation between values, ethics and morals), so I was glad I could respond by saying it's a great topic, but not for this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working software over comprehensive documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responding to change over following a plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently this made me wonder: how do you apply these values? How do you live them? What skills do you need to embody them? In this post I won't be sharing any definitive or complete answers, but as a starting point I have identified four skills needed to embody the four Agile values.&lt;/p&gt;

After sharing my thoughts at &lt;a href="https://citconf.com/virtual2021/"&gt;CitCon Europe 2021 Virtual&lt;/a&gt; and having an interesting conversation about the state of Agile and how to teach it, I figured it's time to write a blog post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I started thinking about this&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Allan Kelly stated in a &lt;a href="https://www.allankellyassociates.co.uk/archives/2762/agile-won-the-war-but-lost-the-peace/"&gt;2018 blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Agile won the war but lost the peace."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is doing Agile, even though very few people are living the dream promised by Agile. This makes it very difficult to use "Agile" as a label, as a name for something. When someone says "Agile", are they referring to what you're already doing or to something they think you should be doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"&gt;Agile Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html"&gt;written in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, based on what its authors were doing in the 1990s in response to the common ways of doing software development of that time. And since the Manifesto we've seen the introduction of Lean, of DevOps, and of CI/CD. So the amount of history that comes with Agile is large and it raises the question how much (if any) we should teach - especially since a lot of it is folklore instead of history&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Doing Agile's history justice would probably cost more time than makes sense if your goal is to teach people how to develop software in an Agile way&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2021/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto/#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And a lot of that history was a relatively long time ago, which is why I titled my CitCon session "Teaching Agile to people younger than the Manifesto".&lt;/p&gt;
