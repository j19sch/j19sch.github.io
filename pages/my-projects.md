## Pytest plugins

Pytest-instrument ([PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-instrument/), [GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/pytest-instrument)) is a plugin to instrument your tests, so you can have the raw event data of your tests in a file of json objects.

Pytest-logfest ([PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-logfest/), [GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/pytest-logfest)) is a plugin that provides three logger fixtures which can write all log records or only those of failed tests to file.
