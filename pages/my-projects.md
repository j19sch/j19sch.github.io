# My projects

Occasionally, and sometimes more often than that, I [blog](/blog/) about these projects. There's also an [RSS](/blog/rss.xml) feed and an [Atom](/blog/feed.atom) feed.

## TestCraftCamp
With some other fine people I organise an annual testing unconference in the Netherlands: [TestCraftCamp](https://testcraftcamp.nl/).

## The four-hour tester
[Helena Jeret-MÃ¤e](https://twitter.com/helenaj_m) and I created the [four-hour tester](https://www.fourhourtester.net/), five exercises teaching five basic testing skills in four hours.

## Pytest plugins

Pytest-instrument ([PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-instrument/), [GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/pytest-instrument)) is a plugin to instrument your tests, so you can have the raw event data of your tests in a file of json objects.

Pytest-logfest ([PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-logfest/), [GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/pytest-logfest)) is a plugin that provides three logger fixtures which can write all log records or only those of failed tests to file.

## Building an API testing framework

Full-day workshop in which you build an API testing framework from scratch using Python, pytest, and the requsts library. All materials can be found
[here](https://github.com/j19sch/building-an-api-testing-framework). These also include examples of next steps and a single test implemented
in using different Python libraries, such as tavern, robot and behave.

## Session-tools
Session-tools ([GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/session-tools)) is a small suite of note-taking tools for session-based test management (SBTM).

## Learning Clojure
In April 2020 I decided I wanted to learn [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) (because functional programming and Lisp) and write about the process. You can find an overview page of what I've written so far [here](/my-projects/learning-clojure).
