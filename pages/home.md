# About me

Joep wandered into testing in 2006. Two years later he discovered context-driven and realized that testing is actually not that bad a fit for a philosopher. In 2015 he joined Mendix, one reason being that he wanted to increase his technical skills. Since then heâ€™s become more and more involved in automation, while also taking on the roles of scrum master, then team lead, and as of October 2018 tech lead testing.

Somewhere along his journey (some say it was 2013) he started speaking at conferences. Outside of work his thoughts tend to revolve around coffee, fountain pens and bouldering.
