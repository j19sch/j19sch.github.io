		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>Joep wandered into testing in 2006. Two years later he discovered context-driven and realized that testing is actually not that bad a fit for a philosopher. In 2015 he joined Mendix, one reason being that he wanted to increase his technical skills. Since then heâ€™s become more and more involved in automation, while also taking on the roles of scrum master, then team lead, and as of October 2018 tech lead testing.</p>
		<p>Somewhere along his journey (some say it was 2013) he started speaking at conferences. Outside of work his thoughts tend to revolve around coffee, fountain pens and bouldering.</p>
