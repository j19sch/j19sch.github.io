<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between">
	<div style="max-width:70%" class="mr-5">
		<p>Joep wandered into testing in 2006. Two years later he discovered context-driven and realized that testing is actually not that bad a fit for a philosopher. In 2015 he joined Mendix, one reason being that he wanted to increase his technical skills. Since then heâ€™s become more and more involved in automation, while also taking on the roles of scrum master. Later he moved on to become a team lead, then a tech lead testing, and currently he is a program manager.</p>
		<p>Somewhere along his journey (some say it was 2013) he started speaking at conferences. Outside of work his thoughts tend to revolve around coffee, fountain pens and bouldering.</p>
