<p>On 30 January 2021 I participated in the Quality Acceleration Peer Conference organized by Huib Schoots and Joost Voskuil. Participants were <a href="https://twitter.com/alanpage">Alan Page</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/unremarkableQA">Areti Panou</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/northern_tester">Ash Winter</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/btknaack">Bart Knaack</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/conorfi">Conor Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/roukedejong">Rouke de Jong</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gwendiagram">Gwen Diagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gdinwiddie">George Dinwiddie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/janetgregoryca">Janet Gregory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joost_voskuil">Joost Voskuil</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpjwolli">Joost van Wollingen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mmeijeri">Martijn Meijering</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/robmeaney">Rob Meaney</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vinwijnl">Vincent Wijnen</a> - with <a href="https://twitter.com/huibschoots">Huib Schoots</a> facilitating the peer conference. The main topics mentioned in the invite were: "How can you sell quality?", "How can you convince people that quality can accelerate software delivery?", and "What limitations or barriers do you hit?"</p>
<p>Reflecting during and after our discussions on these topics, I realized there are some interesting things going on about how we talk about quality and how to sell it. Enough interesting things to fill more than one blog post, so this will be a four-part series. And I might expand on some ideas in the series after that.</p>
<p>The first three parts covered rather philosophical topics: <a href="2021/choosing-your-value-system/">choosing your value system</a>, <a href="2021/who-doesnt-want-quality/">exploring what it means to sell quality</a>, and <a href="2021/management-paradigms-and-quality/">how management paradigms affect quality</a>. At the end of the third post I brought up the main question for this fourth and last post: so now what? If you expect me to get very concrete and specific in this post, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you. What I will do, is share a way to think about actions that has been helpful to me.</p>
<h3>Quality is something emergent</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/charrett">Anne-Marie Charrett</a> says in a blog post titled "<a href="https://mavericktester.com/2018/12/04/emergent-quality/">Emergent Quality</a>":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My hypothesis is that quality is an emergent behaviour. It relies on a whole set of independent systems coming together to create this emergent property. We can never truly know what quality is. It’s constantly changing and morphing into different things. For sure, we can provide examples, but know quality itself? I’m not convinced."</p>

Enough interesting things to fill more than one blog post, so this will be a four-part series. And I might expand on some ideas in the series after that.</p>
<p>This is the third part, exploring five different management paradigms as identified by <a href="https://twitter.com/carolsanford">Carol Sanford</a> in her book "<a href="https://carolsanford.com/the-regenerative-business/">The Regenerative Business</a>" and how they affect quality. The first part was about choosing your value system can be found <a href="2021/choosing-your-value-system/">here</a>. The second part about selling quality can be found <a href="2021/who-doesnt-want-quality/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Psychological cover and psychological safety</h3>
<p>If the challenge of quality is getting several things right (perception, desire, and means) and getting to an agreement among people, how we organize ourselves becomes a crucial topic. As W. Edwards Deming said: "A bad system will beat a good person every time." Or as Kurt Lewin said in a more neutral way: "Behavior is a function of the Person and the Environment." An important part of any environment is psychological safety. In <a href="https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/blog/we're-the-aliens-three-ways-to-seek-safety/">episode 155</a> of their <a href="https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/troubleshooting-agile-podcast/">Troubleshooting Agile</a> podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/Jtf">Jeffrey Fredrick</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel">Douglas Squirrel</a> make an interesting distinction between psychological cover and psychological safety.</p>

<p>This is the second part. The first one about choosing your value system can be found <a href="2021/choosing-your-value-system/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Everyone wants quality, right?</h3>
<p>In the previous post I distinguished two definitions of quality. If we proceed with the second and more interesting one, value to a person who matters, I would argue that everyone wants quality and is already doing their best to get it. The alternative would be that some people are not doing their best to get the things they value - which seems absurd to me.</p>

<h3>Quality has two different meanings</h3>
<p>On the one hand, we use quality when we talk about things that are obviously better. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3mB4MBITEI">$3500 coffee grinder</a> is obviously better than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYGxext8XI">a £50 one</a>. An application that does not crash on you is obviously better than one that does. Almost all other ways to input your phone number are better than <a href="https://qz.com/679782/programmers-imagine-the-most-ridiculous-ways-to-input-a-phone-number/">these</a>.</p>

<p>Yet again it's been a while since I did some Clojure or blogged about it. This time I'm writing this blog post
three months after working on the code on September 5, 6 and 12. I'm not going to dwell on that too long, because
other things in my life were more important. I did feel a little sad when this year's <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>
launched and I realized my Clojure is nowhere near a state where I could attempt the puzzles. So I ended up doing
the first 10 days in Python, which is twice as far as I got last year.</p>
<p>I also feel like my current approach to learning lends itself well enough to going slow. Taking my time to play around
and make notes with while working through a section of <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>
and then revisiting my code and notes later to write a blog post, does seem to result in stuff actually sticking in my memory.
(Disclaimer: am writing this before writing the rest of this blog post.) Slow is smooth and smooth is fast, as they say.</p>
<p>The section I tackled in September is "Pulling It All Together" from Chapter 3, which describes the construction of a 
piece of code of about 50 lines in which - I'm sorry to say -  a hobbit gets hit in different body parts.</p>

<p>It's been more than two months since I did any Clojure - for the obvious reasons. Luckily I did take notes as I proceeded with chapter 3 of "<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>". So the plan is to process these notes into a blog post, which means this post will cover the sections "Data Structures" and "Functions" of that third chapter. Leaving me ready to proceed with the rest of the chapter, i.e. "Pulling It All Together" and the summary and exercises.</p>
<h3>Why is there a <code>when</code>?</h3>
<p>The part about control flow is actually before the part about <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> which I talked about in my <a href="clj3-and-or-being-weird">previous post</a>, but according to my notes I returned to it. I don't remember why to be honest.</p>
<p>The book provides the following example of <code>when</code>:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when </span><span class="nv">true</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">println </span><span class="s">"Success!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="s">"abra cadabra"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; Success!</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; "abra cadabra"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Recently the topic of test case management tools popped up a few times in my surroundings. In almost all cases I'd recommend against using these kinds of tools and I found myself able to give a few reasons, but also found that my thoughts lacked the clarity I'd like them to have. Hence this blog post, to force myself to think more deeply and communicate more clearly.</p>
<p>Before I go into that, there are a few things this blog post is not about. I won't be really going into what effect test cases have on test execution, or rather if test cases are a good tool to use when doing actual testing. Personally I don't think they are and I wrote about my inability to use them in <a href="https://testingcurve.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/test-cases-cant-do-m-no-more/">this post from July 2013</a>. For some deeper thoughts on this, I recommend James Bach's and Aaron Hodder's article "<a href="https://www.testingcircus.com/documents/TestingTrapeze-2014-February.pdf#page=31">Test cases are not testing: Towards a culture of test performance</a>".</p>
<p>What I do want to cover in this post is managing test cases. Having a collection of test cases stored somewhere to re-use across releases and reporting their pass/fail numbers. Both are important use cases for a test case management tool and both are in my opinion a bad idea.</p>

<p>Early in <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/#Control_Flow">chapter 3</a> of the <a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/">Brave and True</a>-book the Boolean operators <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are introduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clojure uses the Boolean operators <code>or</code> and <code>and</code>. <code>or</code> returns either the first truthy value or the last value. <code>and</code> returns the first falsey value or, if no values are falsey, the last truthy value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explanation is followed by some examples:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">or</span> <span class="nv">false</span> <span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="ss">:large_I_mean_venti</span> <span class="ss">:why_cant_I_just_say_large</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; :large_I_mean_venti</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">or</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">=</span> <span class="s">"yes"</span> <span class="s">"no"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; false</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">or</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; nil</span>
</code></pre>

<pre class="code literal-block"><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">and</span> <span class="ss">:free_wifi</span> <span class="ss">:hot_coffee</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; :hot_coffee</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">and</span> <span class="ss">:feelin_super_cool</span> <span class="nv">nil</span> <span class="nv">false</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">; =&gt; nil</span>
</code></pre>

<p>What I found remarkable about this is that <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> do not return a boolean in all cases. Before I go into that, let's back up a second and cover their basics in a little more depth first.</p>

<p>As mentioned in my <a href="clj1-deciding-on-an-editor">previous post</a> I've decided to use <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> as my Clojure editor. That leaves me with three things to do: getting reacquainted with Vim, updating my Vim config in the .<code>vimrc</code> file, and installing both general and Clojure-specific Vim plugins.</p>
<h3>Getting reacquainted with Vim</h3>
<p>Ever since I learned Vim basics a long time ago I have been using it once in a while to make small edits to a config file or a commit message, but not for anything more complicated than that. So that's the first thing I wanted to address: refresh my basics and make sure I know where to find more information when I need it.</p>
<h4>Vimtutor</h4>
<p>I figured that a good way to get back into Vim was the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/usr_01.txt.html#vimtutor">Vimtutor</a>. It's a 30-minute interactive tutorial where you edit a file with instructions with vim. I kept notes of what it covers, which you can find <a href="../my-projects/vimtutor">here</a>. Vim's help also includes a <a href="https://vimhelp.org/quickref.txt.html">quickref</a>, an "Overview of the most common commands you will use", which is intimidatingly long considering that description. As a reference to look things up in, it should be useful, though.</p>

<p>The second chapter of "<a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/">Clojure for the Brave and True</a>" is all about Emacs, "an excellent Clojure editor". Now you might wonder: does your choice of editor really matter that much? You're learning the language, so you don't need advanced IDE features. Some syntax highlighting, some code completion, something to help you manage all those parantheses perhaps, done. That would be true if not for the Clojure REPL.</p>
<h3>The Clojure REPL</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction">REPL</a> is definitely a Thing™️ in Clojure. It gives you a prompt where you can type code and it will execute it immediately. You can also load files with code into it, interacting with the functions and data defined in those. So that's a signifcantly faster feedback loop than having to compile and then run - which is how you'd normally run something written in Clojure, since its primary platform is the JVM. There are <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/repl/launching_a_basic_repl">different ways</a> of launching a REPL, but most guides I found tell you to use <a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>. Oh, and REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print_Loop, because that's what the REPL does.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like this REPL is a bigger deal than I appreciate right now. Probably because I have only just begun learning Clojure. On the other hand, I may have also been spoiled by the quick feedback provided by Python and its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html">IDLE</a>. On the third hand, it's only because of learning of the Clojure REPL, I looked into importing files into Python's IDLE and found out that's indeed a thing it can do.</p>
