<p>In this post, I&#8217;ll tell the story of my eight-month experiment with weekly notes. After that, I&#8217;ll share some tips in case you want to give weekly notes a try&nbsp;too.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h2>The story of my&nbsp;experiment</h2>
<h3>The&nbsp;start</h3>
<p>In December of 2021 I read the <a href="https://agilecommshandbook.com/">&#8220;The agile comms handbook&#8221;</a> and became intrigued by Giles Turnbull&#8217;s idea of &#8220;working in the open&#8221;. Nine months later, in August of 2022, I started a new job at an all-remote company, supporting two teams as a quality engineer. This seemed the perfect opportunity to experiment with that idea in the form of weekly notes: write a short blog post at the end of every week and share it with my&nbsp;colleagues.</p>
<p>It felt a bit daunting to start doing this in my very first week at my very new job, but I also thought it would be really cool to have these weekly notes right from the beginning. So I wrote the first one on Friday 26 August 2022 and shared it with my direct colleagues: my manager, the developers in the two teams I supported, the two product managers, the <span class="caps">UX</span> designer, the department&#8217;s staff engineer, and my fellow quality&nbsp;engineers.</p>
<h3>What I&nbsp;wrote</h3>
<p>Quite quickly I found a basic structure that worked for me: three topics, three paragraphs, each paragraph with a clear focus. Often enough I would divert from that structure, but it would give me a place to start: &#8220;What three things do I want to share this week?&#8221; Once I started writing, I could decide to write something longer about a single topic, or to add a fourth paragraph,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>As to the content, looking back through my weekly notes, there were three recurring&nbsp;elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>stories about what I did, including reflections and lessons learned along the&nbsp;way</li>
<li>mentions of interesting ideas, heuristics, blog posts, videos,&nbsp;&#8230;</li>
<li>celebrations of people who helped me or did something&nbsp;awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>A thing I caught myself doing - luckily well before publishing -, was wanting to continue a discussion I was having with a colleague through my weekly notes. I&#8217;m glad I realized in time that nothing positive would come out of that. Every next post I wrote, I checked to make sure I wouldn&#8217;t fall into that&nbsp;trap.</p>
<h3>Who read&nbsp;it</h3>
<p>The short answer to who read my weekly notes is: not many people. At the start, when I shared the initial page, people definitely went to take a look. After that, some people came back occasionally, others didn&#8217;t. And when I mentioned someone by tagging them on the page, most of the time those people would visit my weekly notes Notion&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>The only people who read my weekly notes on a regular basis, though, were my manager and the principal quality engineer. The principal quality engineer was also the only person who commented on every one of my posts. I really appreciated that, because a goal of my weekly notes was to engage with people. Not to just publish into the&nbsp;void.</p>
<h3>The&nbsp;end</h3>
<p>In early February 2023 layoffs were announced and unfortunately the principal quality engineer was one of the people impacted. A reorg would also go into effect at the start of March, so my manager would no longer be my manager. This led me to reflect on what I wanted from my weekly notes. It took a few more weeks, but eventually I decided to stop writing&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>On Friday 7 April 2023 I wrote my 29th and last weekly&nbsp;note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve <strong>decided to stop</strong> writing these Weekly Notes. No one is reading them anymore. I&#8217;m not sure what their <strong>purpose</strong> is, so I’m also not sure why people would be <strong>interested</strong> in reading them. If I want to <strong>journal</strong>, I can do that in a notebook, without having to be aware of people potentially reading what I&nbsp;write.</p>
<p>If I ever start again, I&#8217;ll do that here, or at least drop a&nbsp;link.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tips if you want to start writing weekly&nbsp;notes</h2>
<p>Even though my story isn&#8217;t one of overwhelming success, I still hope some of you will give writing weekly notes a try. I learned from writing them. They made me reflect on my week and I had to learn to write more concisely and with more focus. I also learned about what works and what doesn&#8217;t when it comes to weekly notes, which will help for next&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>So if you want to start writing  and sharing weekly notes, here are some tips based on my&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it short.</strong> I aimed to write my weekly notes in 30 minutes. It took some practice, but in the end I managed to write them within that timeslot most of the time. Using 3-topics-in-3-paragraphs as a starting point helped me to do so. You could also start with 2-topics-in-2-paragraphs. Or only 1 for that&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p><strong>Write, then edit.</strong> Write a full paragraph, only then edit or even rewrite it. Don&#8217;t start writing the first sentence(s) of a paragraph, then edit what you wrote, write a few more sentences, return to editing, etc. As you write, you discover what you want to write. So do that first, then edit and/or rewrite.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Use highlighting.</strong> Not everyone will be interested in everything you write. Use highlighting (or titles) so people can scan a paragraph and decide if they want to read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Be open.</strong> Share your thoughts and feelings, share the in-between steps you usually don&#8217;t. Share your struggles, share what you&#8217;ve been learning and how. Of course, this assumes you&#8217;re working in an environment where it&#8217;s safe to do&nbsp;so.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it positive.</strong> No continuing of discussions, no complaining, no teaching in a condescending way. That is not to say your weekly notes should be all sunshine and rainbows. Far from it, but the core message should be something like: This is interesting, this is cool, this is intriguing, this is fun, etc. Not: this is dumb, this&nbsp;sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Read the room.</strong> If big things are happening in the organization, take that into account. For example, when the February layoffs were announced, I wrote a single sentence for my Weekly Notes: &#8220;Sad week, people are being laid&nbsp;off.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Keep notes throughout the week.</strong> This also helps with the work itself,<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> but being able to scan through your notes of the past week, makes it a lot easier to decide what you&#8217;d like to write about in your weekly&nbsp;notes.</p>
<p><strong>Respond to engagement.</strong> If someone comments on your weekly notes, respond. At least acknowledge and thank them for engaging with your&nbsp;notes.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect and adjust.</strong> Think about what you want to achieve with your weekly notes. What&#8217;s working and what isn&#8217;t? What are some things you&#8217;d like to try and do&nbsp;differently?</p>
<p><strong>It takes some courage.</strong> Sharing weekly notes might feel a little scary or awkward. You might feel self-conscious. That&#8217;s ok. Having courage means having those feelings and still doing it. As long as your writing comes from a sincere place, it will be ok. People can&nbsp;tell.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I recommend reading Giles Turnbull&#8217;s <a href="https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html">tips on weeknotes</a> and his <a href="https://agilecommshandbook.com/">The agile comms book</a>. After all, his book is what inspired me to try out writing weekly&nbsp;notes.</p>
