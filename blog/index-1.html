<p>(I wrote a follow-up to this post in June 2019: <a href="2019/how-this-tester-writes-code/">how this tester writes code</a>.)</p>
<p>In 1984 Abelson and Sussman said in the Preface to '<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. <strong>Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</strong> Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This oft-quoted sentence I emphasized, is even more true if the purpose of our programs is test automation<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="2015/test-automation-five-questions-leading-to-five-heuristics/#fn:1">1</a></sup>. So let's say you run your test automation program and the result is a list of passes and fails.  The purpose of testing is to produce information. You could say that this list of results qualifies as information and I would disagree. I would say it is data, data in need of interpretation. When we attempt this interpretation, we should consider the following five questions.</p>

<p>Last week while talking with two colleagues, one of them mentioned the verification/validation thing. And I noticed it made me feel uneasy. Because I know well enough what is meant by the distinction, but on a practical level I simply can't relate to it. When I think about what I do as a software tester and how verification versus validation applies to it, nothing happens. Blank mind. Crickets. Tumbleweed.
So after giving it some thought, I present you with three arguments against the verification-validation dichotomy.</p>
<p>First of course, we have the obligatory interlude of defining these two terms. A place to start is the Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_verification_and_validation">Software verification and validation</a>. Unfortunately it contains conflicting definitions, so if anyone cares enough, please do fix. Luckily there's also the general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation">Verification and validation</a> page of Wikipedia, which gives us (among others) the tl;dr version of the distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification: <em>Are we building the product right?</em>
</li>
<li>Validation: <em>Are we building the right product?</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there's the <a href="http://www.istqb.org/downloads/finish/20/145.html">ISTQB glossary v2.4</a> that borrows from ISO 9000:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification: <em>Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled.</em>
</li>
<li>Validation: <em>Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now on to the three arguments.</p>

<h3>Testing as an information problem</h3>
<p>Testing is an information problem. We are in search of certain information, of an answer to the question: does this application fulfill the relevant explicit and implicit expectations? The exact way in which we can answer this question, however, is not immediately clear. First we will need to decide which questions to ask, how to ask them and how to evaluate the responses. Hence, testing is an information problem.</p>
<p>For the traditional test methodologies (ISTQB and TMap being the most well-known) the test case is a large part of the solution. So let's take this solution apart epistemologically and see what it is we have in front of us. If the traditional test case is our solution, what information does a test case contain? What changes occur after executing it? And also, where is the understanding in all of this that's happening?</p>
<p>In this article, I will first describe how a typical test case is created and how it is used. Then we shall take a look at which kinds of information a test case contains. Finally, we will analyze where the understanding of what happens during testing, is present and where it is not.</p>

<p>For those of you who weren't aware yet: something happened at CAST 2014 regarding the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Software Testing. For instance, first <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A721ltyVw3o&amp;list=PLQB4l9iafcelXpJnK6IyDsoFeEb1icqrl">this</a> happened, which resulted in <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/stop29119">this</a> and <a href="http://www.professionaltestersmanifesto.org/">this</a> and a whole bunch of other initiatives.</p>
<p>And then someone on twitter (forgot who, apologies) suggested watching Stuard Reid's Eurostar webinar "ISO 29119 â€“ the new set of international standards on software testing" which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4W-jWRldj0">here</a>. Since I liked to learn more about the standard, but not enough to pay almost 500â‚¬ to <a href="http://www.nen.nl/Zoekresultaten.htm?q=iso+29119">NEN</a> (Dutch standards organisation) for parts 1 to 3, I began watching the webinar.
And truth be told, I didn't watch all of it. Some parts were boring, some parts sounded quite reasonable and some parts I..euh..skipped. And that's ok because all I want to discuss is this one particular quote that begins at 33:25:</p>

<p>Why am I context-driven? Because it's more fun.</p>
<p>That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>Of course I could argue that becoming context-driven has made me a better tester and I do think it has. Yet it's not the reason I became a context-driven tester. Besides, how would I prove it made me a better tester?</p>
<p>So no, I am context-driven because it's more fun. Because it sees testing as an intellectual challenge. Because it allows human uncertainty to be at the core of what it is. Because it tells me that I'm in charge of what I do and how I do it. Because it encourages me to dive in at the deep end of some complex problem, trusting on my skills to get out on top and enjoying every step of the way.</p>

<p>Defect severity 'Skynet': If this gets to production, we're screwed. Really screwed.</p>
<p>The problem with templates is that the people who need them shouldn't be writing the document in the first place and that the people who don't need them, have trouble shaking off the vague sense of obligation to adhere to them.</p>
<p>Happy path application: application that works perfectly fine as long as you stick to the beaten path with your eyes half-closed.</p>

<p>As I am enjoying these short, not very nuanced, not extremely well thought out blog posts, hereâ€™s another one.</p>
<p>Some people seem to think that it makes sense to think of testing as a project within a project, so they apply project management tools and techniques to testing. This simply doesnâ€™t work.</p>
<p>Because what are the tools and techniques do they use? A plan with milestones no one is ever going to make as unexpected stuff tends to happen. A budget that is too tight because itâ€™s based on that same plan. Entry criteria that are not met, but never mind, weâ€™re running out of time so you need to start testing anyhow. And finally exit criteria that we fail to meet as well, but hey weâ€™ll go live anyway, because the software really isnâ€™t that bad (or so we hope).</p>
<p>So in the end, a lot of time and effort is spent on producing documents that are of little use in guiding the actual testing effort. The only thing they do is give some people a warm and fuzzy illusion of control.</p>

<p>Continuing the style of my previous blog post...</p>
<p>Some days ago I found myself no longer able to think in test cases while testing. Of course, it's not as if I was using test design techniques to generate test cases one day and woke up the next day to find myself unable to do it anymore. But still, about a week ago I figured I had explored enough to be able to write down the test cases I wanted to execute and found myself staring at a blank page (well ok, empty Excel sheet) feeling alienated from what I was planning to do.</p>
<p>So what do I mean when saying "thinking in test cases". Simply put, you take a piece of functionality, let a test design technique loose on it and there you go: a set of test cases to execute. Combine test design techniques over the different pieces of functionality as required and you're all covered test strategy-wise. Or that's the idea.</p>

<p>Ok, going to try to keep this short and ranty (rantish?).</p>
<p>Typical test advice is to do a Product Risk Analysis (PRA, mind the capitalisation!) and based on that you decide what to test and how thoroughly. The most common way to do a PRA is with a workshop. Put some people in a room with a lot of stickies, let them list all the risks they can think of and then have them score them. Et voilÃ , Product Risk Analysis is done!</p>
<p>But that doesn't really make sense, now does it? If someone were to give you an object and asked you "What could possibly go wrong with this?", what would you do? Gather a bunch of people with some knowledge of the object, yet no actual experience with it and do a workshop imagining things that could go wrong? That's not an Analysis (capital A!), that's a SWAG â€“ a scientific wild ass guess.</p>
