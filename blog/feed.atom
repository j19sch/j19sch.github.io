    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to write a release advice. My first thought was: &lt;em&gt;"I have close to two decades of experience in testing. I got this!"&lt;/em&gt; My second thought was: &lt;em&gt;"I haven't written a release advice in over ten years, how do I do this again?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the first thought reflected reality a lot better than the second one. And after reviews by my team members, my project lead, and our manager, I'm proud of the end result. Even though in some ways the document has ended up more like a release decision, than a release advice. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;Lead with the actual advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was going to start the document with a management summary, then an introduction, an overview of the testing that was done, the relevant known issues and remaining risks, then the actual release advice and finally some ideas on how to improve our testing further. Quite soon I realized that didn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three basic truths about planning</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;A plan is a not-unrealistic scenario for the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plan is a valid option to get from here to there, from where we are now to where we want to be. The plan might be difficult and challenging. We night not know all the steps. It might have a small chance of success. But it is not unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;The purpose of a plan is to change the plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans are made at the start of things. Once we get going, we learn things about ourselves, about the world, about the plan. The point of a plan is not to stick to it. The point of the plan is to get started, learn, and change the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;The value of an estimate is in the response to the estimate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to give an estimate that's accurate and precise. That's fine, because the value is not in the estimate. The value is in the response to the estimate. To elicit a response, a rough estimate based on intuition often is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 18 of "Taking Testing Seriously" (I skipped ahead, sue me), &lt;a href="https://qualityremarks.com/"&gt;Keith Klain&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much today is about "continuous everything" - continuous deployment, continuous integration - and speed. The pace at which people are doing things is really, really disruptive to thinking deeply about problems. Then the goal gets displaced from getting good products and services to customers quickly, and turns into, "How do we back something out quickly when we inevitably screw up?" It's continuous everything - except continuous thinking.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- Taking Testing Seriously, James Bach, Michael Bolton et al., 2025, p. 424&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a point. But I got there by first kind of disagreeing with what he said. Because "continuous everything" is not about speed. It's about risk. Or rather, about managing certain risks: the risk of (code) integration and the risks of delivery/deployment. And how fast you go, should not just be determined by those two specific risks. (Or even worse, by the fact that you just think it's really cool that you can release every commit to your users.) It should be determined by your overall risk appetite, which is a much broader perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Testing types - beyond definitions</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing types in software testing are a mess. It's not just &lt;a href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2016/regression-testing-it-means-less-than-you-think/"&gt;"regression testing"&lt;/a&gt; that can mean more things than there are people in the room. It's true for basically all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last week a teammate said &lt;em&gt;"We should also do integration testing."&lt;/em&gt; So I asked &lt;em&gt;"What do you mean by integration testing?"&lt;/em&gt;. And the reply was: &lt;em&gt;"Testing the frontend and backend together using Playwright."&lt;/em&gt; Which made me think &lt;em&gt;"I see what you mean, but I would never call that integration testing."&lt;/em&gt; and made me reply: &lt;em&gt;"Yeah, we should."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical solution to this problem is to start defining the different testing types. To me, that's just one approach of many to make sense of testing types. So far I've come up with an additional five.&lt;/p&gt;

And no, I'm sorry, they didn't go into any detail about what happened in those two weeks. In my current project our pipeline takes 0 people about 17 minutes to run.&lt;/p&gt;

That changes with this post. I will provide a brief description for each of the five areas. I'll share some ideas how a list of the five areas of Agile might be useful. And I'll reflect on the question: Are they the five areas of good software development or of Agile software development?&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish people would share more of what they do day-to-day. Especially testers and quality engineers. Show the work you do. On the other hand, I do realize that that's hard. You don't want to share sensitive information. You want to respect the privacy of your team. And then there's the whole practical side. How much of the context do you need to share to have an intelligible story?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since my current project is open source and my team works in public, I have more options than most. So let's see if this kind of post works out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was my first week back at work after a few weeks of vacation. So an important part of my week was catching up. Going through emails and chat messages. Talk with my fellow team members. Participate in the usual meetings. Some stuff that didn't make it into this post. More importantly, there are three things I did, that give a good idea of what a significant part of my job looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How essential are your testers?</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A question I don't seem to be able to let go of is: where does a tester fit into a software development team? More specifically, how essential are testers to the team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there are basically three options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do not add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not clear if your testers add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your testers do add something essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 class="small"&gt;Your testers do not add something essential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this is becoming more and more common. Thanks to Agile, CI/CD, DevOps, improved tooling and changing expectations, you should not have testers that find the dumb bugs I was expected to find at the start of my career. If a programmer wrote a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; where it should have been a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, we should expect a unit test and not a tester to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five levels of note-taking in meetings</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;level 0: no one takes notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few things confuse me as much as being a meeting with no one taking notes. Is everyone's memory so much better than my own? Is what's being said just not that important? Are people fine with only retaining a few things and nothing else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I'm not alone. Johanna Rothman seems to agree with me, at least for &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; meetings:&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="https://smallsheds.garden/blog/2025/five-levels-of-note-taking-in-meetings/#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a meeting is essential, it will have an agenda. It will have minutes. It will have a list of action items, and someone will manage them so that people are accountable for their action items.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy"&gt;Modern Management Made Easy&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.jrothman.com/"&gt;Johanna Rothman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why it's level 0. There's no reason to ever be at this level. Borrow some pen and paper. use your phone. The least you can do is take notes for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
