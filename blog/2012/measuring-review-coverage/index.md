Recently it occurred to me we have plenty of ways to measure test coverage, but there doesn't seem to be a way to measure review coverage. So today I decided to fix that. The result is the scale below with which you can measure review coverage. And just like all good scales, [it goes all the way up to 11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuzpsO4ErOQ).

0) I'm sorry, what document?  
1) I think I do remember someone mentioning that document.  
2) I'm sure I have it somewhere â€“ well, at least fairly sure...  
3) Look, it's on my to do-pile!<!-- TEASER_END -->  
4) Did you know the number of characters in your document is a prime number?  
5) I was just about to begin my review, but then something important came up.  
6) The table of contents looks really good.  
7) I saw a few typos; you really should run a spell check on that.  
8) What do you mean that's not the document you are talking about?  
9) I skimmed it. Didn't see any issues worth mentioning.  
10) I read it attentively and checked it against the project documentation. Here's a list with my findings.  
11) I hired a team of experts at my own expense to do the review. Here's the report.
