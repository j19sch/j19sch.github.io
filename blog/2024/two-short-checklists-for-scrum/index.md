# checklist no.1 {.small}
- Do you add acceptance criteria and story points to each ticket before planning?
- Do you have daily team meetings where people provide updates on their progress?
- After each iteration, do you report to stakeholders what work was done and what will be planned next?

# checklist no.2 {.small}
- Is the team protected during the sprint from stakeholders trying to interfere?
- Is a sprint focused on achieving a goal and is how that goal is achieved, left sufficiently open?
- Does the team address impediments as soon as they are discovered?
