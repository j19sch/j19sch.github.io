Yesterday [Elizabeth Zagroba](https://elizabethzagroba.com/), [Huib Schoots](https://www.huibschoots.nl/), [Sanne Visser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/techsannetized/) and I ran another [FroGS conf](https://frogsconf.nl) online open space. There were plenty of great sessions, below are some notes from the five sessions I participated in. Thank you to everyone who was there, I had a great time!

If you want to join one of our next FroGS conf events, head over to [our site](https://frogsconf.nl/) and [subscribe](https://frogsconf.nl/register/) to our newsletter.

# From notes to shared documentation culture {.small}
- Co-creation works for code. In what ways is co-creation for documentation different?
- Why do we talk about "an audience" for documentation, instead of about "the contributors"?
- The purpose of documentation flips from "what we build" to "what we built".
- Old research paper on documentation: only documentation with lasting usefulness is architecture and test cases. Everything else is just notes.
- Documentation heuristic: Is it easier/faster to reverse engineer it instead?<!-- TEASER_END -->
- Documentation is a tool, a means to an end. What does it help you do?
- "Schr√∂dingers documentation: If there are docs, no one will read them. If there are no docs, everyone will complain."[^1] - Marit van Dijk
- Book tip: Writing Effective Use Cases by Alistair Cockburn

# Outsourcing bespoke open source software {.small}
- Split the payment into a monthly fee and a risk/incentive fund.
- From an Agile perspective it makes sense to put your acceptance tester into the development team. However, acceptance is linked to milestone-based payment. So you'll want something more for acceptance than your tester in the development team.
- Give both parties power and incentive. For example: the client does not have to pay for sprint if quality is insufficient. If that happens twice, the contractor can leave the project.
- You want the contractor involved in requirements gathering, but be careful it doesn't turn into the contractor deciding your acceptance criteria.
- The earlier you open source the code, the easier, but also the scarier.


# Thoughtleadership vs delivery goals, balancing or combining the two {.small}
- Common route: delivery focus first, then develop thoughtleadership.
- Make sure you balance the two in a way that fits you.
- They require a different type of network.
- There's a tipping point. When people start to realize you can do both, they will come to you for both.
- Shadow someone who does what you want to do.
- Book tip: An Everyone Culture by Robert Kegan & Lisa Lahey


# No Vehicles in the Park {.small}
- A vehicle is any object that's used for transportation of goods, people, regardless of surface.
- Shoes are not a vehicle. Wheelie shoes when walking are not a vehicle, when sliding they are.
- The rule says, ["No vehicles in the park"](https://novehiclesinthepark.com/). - a game about language and rules
- Levels of vehicularity apply.
- What's the reason behind the rule? What's its purpose?
- Is violating the rule allowed? Do you want it happen regardless of the rule?
- Book tip: The Four Tendencies by Gretchen Rubin


# Improving effectiveness of testing/testers across teams {.small}
- Safety is crucial. What is valuable to do? How will people be evaluates?
- What's hard and/or slow?
- There are plenty of easy wins.
- As Woody Zuill says: Turn up the good.
- Tools: impact mapping, A3 problem solving.
- Get people to do things together, e.g. through a community of practice.


# Some of the sessions I missed  {.small}

There were also some interesting sessions that I missed, because I can only be in place at a time:

- How to find employers that value quality (and you)?
- Capture the Flag Together: Security Testing for Everyone
- Making changes from the inside out vs. outside in
- Building a practice app for all things software and testing (ensemble)
