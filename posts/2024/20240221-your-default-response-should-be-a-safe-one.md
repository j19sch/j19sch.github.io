In his training video "Ukemi from the ground up," Ellis Amdur explains how your default action should always be a safe one. In the context of the video it's about what your action should be in response to an Aikido technique like kote gaeshi: do you jump and do a breakfall? Or do you roll?

<!-- explain what kote gaeshi is -->

The tricky part of that decision is if you roll when you should have done a breakfall, you'll likely break your wrist. If you do a breakfall when you could have rolled, you might look like you're exaggerating. So what do you want to do when there's no time to think? No time to make a conscious decision?

Well, it's not really about what you want anymore, because there is no time to think. Whatever your default is, that's what your body will do. That's why your default should be the breakfall, the option that is safe in both circumstances - both when it's required and when it's optional.

<!-- this is an extremely cool idea. Can you consider making it a pull quote or somehow highlighting it more? maybe another para:

That's why we practice defaults in aikido and why I recommend testers practice defaults in their work. When we practice the breakfall or the testing equivalent, we have the safe option, whether it's required or optional.

(ANd now I need you to explain the breakfall in more detail. See that first comment.) -->

In software development we luckily don't have to make many decisions that might result in harm to our own bodies. (Plenty of harm to be done in software regardless, though.) So arguably there's always time to think. The problem, however, is rather that there's too many things to think about. You want to be thinking about the important part of the problem and do the rest on auto-pilot. Stick with your defaults. And if we're going to stick to our defaults, we too better make sure that they are safe ones.

# Git status all the things {.small}
One of my defaults is to do git status as basically every other git command. And I know I'm not the only one. <!-- dig up Mastodon post? --> And yes, I do have my command line set up so that it tells me what branch I'm on and what state that branch is in.

Still, a normal set of git actions for me is:

- git status
- git add .
- git status
- git commit
- git status (and/or git log)
- git push

I also know that until I push, I can easily correct what I'm doing. And even after pushing, if it's just my branch, no one is going to mind a quick force push.

And yet, I git status all the time, because I want to get it right the first time. And because if my habit is to git status, I'm not going to make any mistakes. And the one time I'm in a rush or under pressure, and I'm more likely to mess something up, I will have my default of git status-ing all the time, making it more likely that I catch my mistake before it ends up in a commit.

<!-- Does everyone use git these days? I'm old, so my most recent experience is with subversion. (I know!!! Old!) If everyone uses git, then disregard this comment. But if some people do not use git, do a one-sentence description of what git status is. I suspect it's whether someone's checked this out with incomplete changes or all changes are checked in. But I could be wrong. -->


# Always take notes {.small}
I always take notes. In meetings. In 1-to-1s. About what I do every day. And I take notes when I'm trying to figure something out. Such as, how to get a certain piece of software to work on my machine. Or when I'm doing some exploratory testing.

Most of the time, I don't return to those notes after I'm done with whatever I wanted to do. Sometimes I do, however. Sometimes I even edit them and clean them up and share them in the team wiki. Most of the time, though, the value of my notes is during the thing I'm doing. That I'm not sure anymore what exactly it is that I did, or in what order. Then it's great to have notes from your past self to tell you.

And what's very much not great, is being in the middle of figuring something out, having a question about what you did five minutes ago, not being able to answer that question from the top of your head, but also having no notes to fall back on.

So that's why I take notes. They help me during the thing, to look back into and to help me focus and structure. And that's enough value that I'd rather take notes too often, then having to retrace and redo all my steps, just because I couldn't be bothered to write some things down.


# Going on a stupid little walk {.small}
I'm perfectly capable of not leaving my house unless I have an errand to run or have to go to the office. I know it's better to at least go on a stupid little walk every day. If that's a choice I have to make, however, I'm likely to just postpone with good reason(s) until it's time to go to bed. So that's not a very safe default, although the consequences of that default may take quite some time to materialize.

~~Due to several reasons - the main one living with someone who will go for a walk every day - I have been getting better of going on a daily stupid little walk.~~

Luckily I have been getting better at going on a daily stupid little walk - thanks to various reasons, but I can't claim it's become my default. What has become a default is doing a [short morning exercise routine](https://gmb.io/morning-mobility/) to get myself ready for the day. I know it's the default, because often enough I find myself waking up, not feeling like doing it and then doing it anyway - without much thought or decision making in between. It's just what I do every morning.

What are some of your default actions in certain situations? How safe are they? And what has worked for you to change some of your defaults?

<!-- this piece is almost done. It needs a wrap, which might include this series of questions. And then a callback to the breakfall idea. Then, ship it. -->
