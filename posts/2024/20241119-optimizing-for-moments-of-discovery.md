(old) optimizing the moment

- thin vertical slices FTW -> serves both, JIT design and test
- what about req eng later?
- should have been requirement or test
- should have been sooner or later
- ET early because for some stuff it's more effective than req eng
- continuous ET and req eng, instead of all design upfront, ET at the end
