Exploratory testing is a learned skill, as I claimed in my previous post *["Being intentional about exploratory testing"](link://slug/being-intentional-about-exploratory-testing)*. In that post I mentioned the importance of two skills: noticing what there is to notice and deciding what to do next.

Turns out it's not the first time I mentioned that pair of skills. In a post about [how to teach Agile](link://slug/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto#noticing-options-principles), I quoted from John Mason's *"Researching Your Own Practice, The Discipline of Noticing"*

> All professional development could be described as changes in sensitivity to notice and accumulation of alternative actions to initiate. (p. 147)

That does raise the question if we can't get a bit more specific about the skills that comprise the overall skill of exploratory testing. So I've come up with six more skills, making a total of eight. For some reasons they ended up as questions rather than verbs. I like how that makes this post less of a checklist and more of a tool for self-reflection.

> "The real work in noticing is to draw the moment of awakening from the retrospective into the present, closer and closer to the point at which a choice can be made." (p. 76)

trick: there isn't much retrospect, how do you remember everything (/ most of) that happened during testing?

# How do you decide what to do next? {.small}

# How many alternatives can you imagine? {.small}
How many possibilities can you imagine? Things to try? Things that might happen?

# How do you model the different aspects of what you're testing? {.small}

# How rich an varied are the oracles you use for evaluating what you discover? {.small}

# How do you record what you notice and decide and do while testing? {.small}

# What tools do you use that support, extend and/or amplify your testing? {.small}

# What do you leave behind for future use? {.small}
test reports, test guides, test automation? test scripts

# notes

## skills mentioned in previous post

heuristics, noticing, deciding

Having these lists of heuristics is a great start, but applying them hinges on two skills: noticing what there is to notice, and choosing the right heuristic to apply. Neither can be done perfectly. You can't notice everything. You can't know upfront what the exact right heuristic is.

But you can do these (noticing and deciding) rather well or rather poorly. And that's the invisible skill of exploratory testing. Invisible, because it's all in the mind of the person doing the exploratory testing. And as any other skill, exploratory testing can be practiced and refined. It's not something some people just happen to do well, while others don't.

## learning needs doing

What's crucial to me in that list, is that the skill in exploratory testing is in doing the exploratory testing. So the best way to learn, is to pair up or ensemble with others, preferably including someone who already has built up quite some skills. And as you test, reflect on what you're doing and discuss it with each other.
