balancing act

dynamic across three dimensoins

three axes of trouble

inherently unstable

---

Throughout the years I've had many different testing-related roles: tester in a separate testing team, tester in an Agile team, test coordinator/manager, principal test engineer, and quality engineer. It's during my [recent time as a quality engineer](link://slug/im-a-quality-engineer-and-im-not-sure-how-i-feel-about-that), that I realized that all testing-related roles inherently unstable. They require a constant balancing act across three axes:

- doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others;
- being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team;
- doing your job versus improving the system.

This balancing act happens both in the long term and in the short term. In the long term as you change jobs, change companies, develop skills, develop new interests. In the short term as in a single day you work with different people, in different areas, from different perspectives. Pairing on unit tests with an experienced developer is a very different game from discussing the business and process risks of a feature with a newly joined colleague.

unsolved problem in software engineering

dynamic along three axes:

- doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others
- being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team
- doing your job versus improving the system

structure: pros and cons of each end of each axis


## from blog post

My experiences as a quality engineer also made me reflect on testing-related roles in general. Throughout my career I’ve been through quite a few of them: tester in a separate testing team, tester in an Agile team, principal test engineer, and as described in this experience report, quality engineer.

I’ve come to the conclusion that they are all inherently unstable. They require a constant balancing act across three axes:

- doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others;
- being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team;
- doing your job versus improving the system.

It’s very hard to support others testing without doing any testing yourself. Yet any testing you do, might become your domain, with others leaving it to you to test. It’s great to be in the same team as the developers and designers and business analysts. It also gets lonely, so you form an informal team with people in a similar role as yours. It’s important to do your job, but to do a good job you discover you first have to change the organization a little (or a lot).

So even though your official job description puts you clearly on one end of each axis - for example my quality engineering role was supporting testing by others, being embedded in a team, and doing my job -, you can only make that work by constantly observing and adjusting your actual position on these three axes. You need to work as much inside the existing structures, as around them. That makes these roles challenging and interesting, but often enough also frustrating. And yet, I wouldn’t want it any other way.
