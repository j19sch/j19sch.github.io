# A scrum master is the Scrum boss

As "[The 2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master)" says:

> The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.

> The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

# A scrum master changes across versions of the Scrum Guide

If you really want to dig into this, I reproduced [the "The Scrum Master" section of all seven verions]((/my-projects/the-scrum-master-role-across-the-scrum-guide)) of the Scrum Guide. In this post, I'll focus in the differences between the [current](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf) and the [previous](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf) version of the Scrum Guide.

A big difference is that the current version (2020) mentions "Scrum Master" 12 times, while the previous version (2017) mentions it 34 times. The reason can be found in the [Scrum Guide Revision History](https://scrumguides.org/revisions.html). The 2020 version is "Even Less Prescriptive" and has "Overall Simplification of Language for a Wider Audience". Where the 2017 version counted 19 pages and 7.012 words, the 2020 version is only 13 pages and 4.075 words long.

One interesting difference outside the "The Scrum Master" section that is worth mentioning, is that in the 2017 version the description of each Scrum Event says that the Scrum Master ensures that it takes place. In the 2020 version, the Scrum Master is only mentioned once for one event, the Daily Scrum: *"If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers."*

The biggest differences are (obviously) in the "The Scrum Master" section itself. I'll list the significant ones below.


## Subtle changes in choice of words

### Accountable or responsible?

The 2017 version has the Scrum Master *"responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide"*.

The 2020 version changes this to *"accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide."*

That seems significant. If a team is not Scrum-ing properly, the Scrum Master of the 2020 version is in more trouble than the 2017 one.

### Servant-leader or leader who serves?

The 2017 version says *"The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team."*.

The 2020 version says basically the same, but avoids the term "servant-leader": *"Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization."*

In "[Words that changed in Scrum Guide 2020 update](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/words-changed-scrum-guide-2020-update)" Dave West explains this change:   
>The 2017 guide used the term “Servant Leadership” to describe the style of leadership that serves Scrum Teams well. This idea is still valid, however, the 2020 Scrum Guide places more emphasis on leadership, removing the potential misinterpretation that Scrum Masters are servants first and leaders second. Understanding the idea of servant leadership is still valuable when using Scrum.


## Effectiveness through practices or the environment?

The 2017 version links the value created by the Scrum Team to the interactions with those outside the team:
> The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

The 2020 version does not mention this at all and links the team's effectiveness to its practices:
> The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.


## How to serve others

In the 2017 version the three lists of how a Scrum Master serves others, is in the order: Product Owner, Development Team, Organization.

In the 2020 version the order is: Scrum Team, Product Owner, organization.

The reason for this might be as simple as the [change in the 2020 version](https://scrumguides.org/revisions.html) of no longer having a Development Team, with the Scrum Master and Product Owner outside of that team. Instead, there's now one Scrum Team with three different sets of accountabilities: PO, SM, and Developers.

Still, I find it intriguing that until the 2020 version, serving the Product Owner gets mentioned before serving the Development Team.


### Serving the Development/Scrum Team

The 2017 version has the Scrum Master *"Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress"*, while the 2020 version says *"Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress"*.

In the 2017 version the Scrum Master serves the team by *"Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed"*. In the 2020 version this becomes *"Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox"*. So it seems that instead of mentioning for every event that the Scrum Master needs to ensure it takes place (2017 version), the 2020 version now mentions it once.

### Serving the Product Owner

In the 2017 version, one of the ways for the Scrum Master to serve the Product Owner is *"Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible"*. This responsibility is not present in the 2020 version.

There's also an interesting difference in the choice of verbs throughout the list. The 2017 version has 2x ensuring, 1x finding, 1x helping, 2x understanding, 1x practicing, and 1x facilitating. The 2020 version has 3x helping, 1x facilitating.

### Serving the organization
None of the changes seemd siginificant enough to me to mention in this post/

# A scrum master is RE-TRAINED and has BELIEF

In "Scrum Mastery: From Good To Great Servant Leadership" Geoff Watts does not focus on what scrum masters do, but on how they behave. As he writes himself on page 21:

> A good ScrumMaster grasps the responsibilities of the role.  
> A great ScrumMaster grasps the skills and mindset of the role.

Most of the book explains the characteristics of a great servant leader through the RE-TRAINED acronym:

> - Respected: They have a reputation for integrity both within the team and in the wider organization.
> - Enabling: They are passionate about helping others be effective.
> - Tactful: They are diplomacy personified.
> - Resourceful: They are creative in removing impediments to productivity.
> - Alternative: They are prepared to promote a counter-culture.
> - Inspiring: They generate enthusiasm and energy in others.
> - Nurturing: They enjoy helping both individuals and teams develop and grow.
> - Empathetic: They are sensitive to those around them.
> - Disruptive: They break the old status quo adn help create a new way of working.

At the end of the book, Geoff Watts also lists the key areas of growth for truly great ScrumMasters.
> - Believe
> - Enquire
> - Listen
> - Illuminate
> - Encourage
> - Facilitate



# A scrum master is a full-time role

It's a full-time role for a single team. "Scrum Mastery: From Good To Great Servant Leadership" - Geoff Watts


# A scrum master is something between a captain and a coach

Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time - Jeff Sutherland

> [...] we needed someone whose job it was to make sure the process itself was effective. Not a manager - more of a servant-leader, something between a team-captain and a coach." p62

> He or she would facilitate all the meetings, make sure there was transparency, and, most important, help the team discover what was getting in their way. They key part of that was to realize that often the impediments aren't simply that the machine doesn't work or that Jim in accounting is a jerk - it's the process itself. It was the Scrum Master's job to guide the team toward *comtinuous improvement* - to ask with regularity, "How can we do what we do better?"" p62


# A scrum master is a Wise Fool

Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time - Jeff Sutherland

> He or she needs to be able to see the problem and bring it up with the team. It's crucial that someone asks the hard questions. p164

> The "Wise Fool" is the person who asks uncomfortable questions or raises uncomfortable truths.  These workers aren't always easy to have around, since jthey can be seen as troublemakers or not part of teh team, but they need to be cultivated and used. p164

# A scrum master covers only 2 of 5 areas of software development

five areas from post 2021 [An approach to teaching Agile 20 years after the Agile Manifesto](link://slug/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto)

the two: work management and reflect & experiment

# A scrum master is also familiar with kanban, lean, and DevOps

pair and ensemble programming?




# So what is a scrum master?

I'm really not sure any more.

It's as if we expect devopers to be able to program, testers to test, prodict owners to create user stories, UX designers to design, team leads and engineering managers to manage, but we don't expect them to be able to work as a team, to be able to deliver software together effectively.

That *is* kind of odd, isn't it?
