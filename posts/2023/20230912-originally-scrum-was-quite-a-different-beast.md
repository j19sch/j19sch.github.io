In 2001, nine years before the first version of the Scrum Guide[^1], Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle published "Agile Software Development with Scrum". Scrum as described in that book is quite a different beast from what it is today.

Here are the three things that struck me most while reading it:

In this post I'll share the three differences that I found most intriguing.

[^1]: The first version of the Scrum Guide was published in February 2010. You can find a [copy](https://res.cloudinary.com/mitchlacey/image/upload/v1589750495/Scrum_Guide_v1_Scrum_Alliance_qe0y2w.pdf) on Mitch Lacey's site.

# A different breed of scrum master

[What is a scrum master?](link://slug/what-is-a-scrum-master)

[Scrum master or scrum mascot?](link://slug/scrum-master-or-scrum-mascot)

two mentions in index: change agent p142, definition p31

## Authority

> The Scrum Master is a new management role introduced by Scrum. The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that Scrum values, practices, and rules are enacted and enforced. *(p 31)*

> The Team Leader, Project Leader, or Project Manager often assume the Scrum Master role. Scrum provides this person with the structure to effectively carry out Scrum's new way of building systems. If it's likely that many impediments will have to be initially removed, this position may need to be filled by a senior manager or a Scrum consultant. *(p 32)*

> How does the Scrum Master keep the team working at the highest level of productivity? The Scrum Master does so primarily by making decisions and removing impediments. When decisions need to be made in the Daily Scrum, the Scrum Master is responsible for making the decisions immediately, even with incomplete information. *(p 32)*

> The Scrum Master needs to have management's full support and engagement. Most importantly, the Scrum Master needs to have the authority to cause impediments to be removed. If management disagrees with actions that the Scrum Master takes, it should offer suggestions, provide guidance, and give coaching. But no matter what, management must support the Scrum Master. *(p 142)*

> However, the Scrum Master needs to know what authority he has to rapidly resolve impediments. If the answer is "not much," then maybe the organization in question isn't ready to implement Scrum. *(p 143)*

## Not the team's internal differences
> As a Scrum Master, I'm often tempted to help a team resolve its internal problems. Experience has taught me not to. The team has committed to a goal. When I help them resolve differences, I'm taking some of their responsibility away. The team committed to the goal; the team gets to figure out how to meet the goal, as best as they can. *(p 36)*

## Also a good engineer
> The best Scrum Masters are also good engineers. The Scrum Master helps the team improve its engineering practices, just as a coach teaches a team to play better. He or she causes the team to reevaluate and discard wasteful practices, and to assess, design and adopt new practices. For instance, Mike Beedle likes many Extreme Programming practices. He has helped Scrum teams implement them within their projects. *(p 60)*

__extra quotes__

> The Scrum Master represents management and the team to each other. At the Daily Scrum, the Scrum Master listens closely to what each team member reports. He or she compares what progress has been made to what progress was expected, based on Sprint goals and predictions made during the previous Daily Scrum. *(p 31-32)*

> As I [Ken Schwaber] ran the daily Scrums for the PNP team, it became apparent that I was fulfilling a management job. I blocked interference, allowed the team to keep focused, removed impediments and helped the team reach decisions quickly. This was a radical change, a flip to what management had previously done. The team figured out how to do what it had committed to do. Management's new and primary job was to maximize the team's productivity, to be there to help it do the best it could. *(p 7)*






# There is no retrospective, or rather it's continuous

daily scrum and review as 'control' moments

if management does not resolve impediments -> cancel sprint

relates to Maaret's: your job is to get better at software development, software is a side-effect

"The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable." - Robert Henri => Woody Zuill


# 30-day sprint with sprint goal and tasks
not necessarily fully planned, adjust as you go based on sprint goal instead of later stories spill over

refer to toot: you're waterfalling because your sprints are too short
