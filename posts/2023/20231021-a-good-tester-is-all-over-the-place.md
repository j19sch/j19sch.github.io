*Before I start this post, I shoud say that we use "tester" in [so many different ways](link://slug/tester-is-an-overloaded-variable), that there are so many different views about what good testing is, let alone what good software development looks like, that either I had to cut a lot of the nuance from this post, or I had to write an extremely long post with so much nuance, it wouldn't be clear anymore if there was a point somewhere in all of it. So I chose for the former approach.*


# Testers do testing

Let's start simple: a tester tests. Then what is testing? I [still like the definition](link://slug/reflections-on-my-testing-manifesto) *"Testing is investigating in order to evaluate a product."* The most obvious thing to investigate, to test, is the code that has been written[^1]. The best way to do this, in my opinion, is through the combination of exploratory testing and test automation. So what [Maaret Pyhäjärvi](https://maaretp.com/) has named ["contemporary exploratory testing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_67oQrPZhQ). So it's not a unitary thing, especially if we also consider the need for strategy, planning, design, and reporting around this testing of the code.

There's more testing to do, though. Looking through monitoring data, attending to CI/CD pipelines, and participating in refinement, also fit my definition of testing.


## But they're not the only ones

But a tester can also do testing by looking at monitoring, attending to CI/CD pipelines, participating in refinement. And that still leaves out some crucial acitivities, such as test strategy and test reporting. And the things we expect from every team member, e.g. participate in the retrospective.

What's curious about testing, though, is that the tester is not the only one doing it. Programmers write code, business analyists gather requirements, product owners set priorities, ux designers design. Others might help out here and there, but it's clear who's in the lead. Yet, when you ask: "Who tests?" The answer should be: "Hopefully not just the tester!"

Maaret: be like water, but sometimes be ice

## Doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others

## Being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team

## Doing your job versus improving the system

## Working inside and outside of the existing structures

What all of these have in common: working inside and outside of the existing structures
