Originally Scrum was very much about *"You tell us what needs building. We'll decide how we build it and how soon we'll deliver."*[^1] I've never seen that version of Scrum. The version I have seen, has a product manager try to get as many features into a sprint as reasonably possible - for varying degrees of reasonable. This comes at the expense of maintenance work, such as keeping libraries up-to-date or removing technical debt. And it incentivises the team to cut corners on features: to not leave code in a better state than they found it, to not fix smaller bugs and instead log them somewhere.

[^1]: See for examples [this Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1405184303126953987.html) by Alistair Cockburn about Scrum's anti-management position and sprint commitment.

One solution I see to this problem, is to fully put an engineering manager in charge of the team. The product manager prioritizes the features. The engineering manager prioritizes the work the team does. That's not a simple change, however.

Another solution might be changing the way we use our backlogs. If a product manager gets to prioritize all the work, and the tool they use is a backlog, then we should make sure that all the work[^2] is in the backlog.

[^2]: Or rather, all the work relevant to a relatively short horizon. The shorter the horizon, the smaller the backlog, the easier it is to manage.

# Features

If you have a backlog, it already contains features. So no need to change anything here. You could argue - as I did in [*"Our work management tools are limiting our imagination"*](link://slug/our-work-management-tools-are-limiting-our-imagination) - that there might be better ways to manage work than having features in a backlog. That's not in scope for this post. The assumption is that you have a backlog, owned by a product manager or owner, containing the upcoming work for the team.


# Bugs

bug: either fix now, or log in backlog as feature, or don't log
bug during story: fix it now or accept ok forever (because either forget or log into backlog)



# Maintenance and tech debt

Features and bugs tend to get added to the backlog, while tech debt doesn't. So the Product Manager has an incomplete view of the actual backlog. Fixing that could help in getting more priority for fixing tech debt.

I should also either not use "tech debt" or explicitly define how I use the term. Currently using it in the sloppy/vague sense of "tech stuff that's making us slower than we could be".

I've seen too many teams where the product owner/product manager makes all the decisions about what work is done and what work is not. Response to that is usually "learn to have better conversations with your PO/PM" instead of putting an engineering manager in charge of the engineering team.

Given that situation, I think putting tech debt in the backlog would help with visibility.

## Some thoughts from other people

This blog post started as a [question on Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@joeposaurus/110031968940811638):

> "What if you started to log technical debt as bugs in Jira?"

In response, [Krys](https://chaos.social/@krys@spore.social) said:

> "I fear relabeling would only reinforce everyoneâ€™s troublesome view of the PO  being the teams boss and having authority/obligation to micromanage their workday instead of demanding technical excellency from the team while trusting them to know best how to get that"

[Markus Tacker](https://chaos.social/@coderbyheart) said:
> "Nothing. Technical debt is valid implementation. As long as developers do not get permission (or sense of urgency) to change it, it will get ignored. Work on providing the resources needed to address it instead."

> "Tech debt impacts the ability to deliver new features. And that's why it does not belong in the backlog. Only features do. If feature backlog is empty, no need to address tech debt. If feature backlog keeps growing: fix tech debt."
