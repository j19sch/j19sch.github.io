During our latest monthly call [Maaret Pyhäjärvi](https://maaretp.com/) and I spent some of our time discussing agency, accountability and scrum masters. At one point I said something along the lines of:

> Scrum masters often end up as scrum mascots.

Maaret said I should write a blog post about scrum mascots[^1], so here we are.

[^1]: I can't imagine being the first person to utter the phrase *"scrum mascot"*, but the only thing I could find is this article about agile mascots by David McThomas: [The Agile Mascot: Propaganda or Embodyment](https://medium.com/coaching-conversations/the-agile-mascot-propaganda-or-embodyment-2cb3398bda6) (May 2020).

According to the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master)[^2] a scrum master is accountable for two things:

- establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
- the Scrum Team's effectiveness.

[^2]: For a longer description of what a scrum master is, including a comparison between the 2017 and 2020 Scrum Guides, see my previous post: [What is a scrum master?](link://slug/what-is-a-scrum-master)


Accountability implies (or rather: should imply) matching/corresponding authority. You're being held accountable for certain outcomes \*and\* you have sufficient power to influence those outcomes. That's a scrum master. A scrum mascot is a very different beast: they have neither power nor accountability. And yet that seems to be what a lot of organizations (and scrum masters?) want.

# Scrum masters have no power

Scrum masters are managers without power. They are managers because they're expected to establish Scrum and ensure the team's effectiveness. Yet, they don't have the power associated with a management role. To decide what needs to be done, there's someone with the title of "product manager". To manage the team and to manage the work, there's someone with the title of "engineering manager".[^3]

[^3]: Which isn't a very Scrum-like way to organize yourself. The [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) has 8 occurences of "manag*": 1x "current management", 2x "Product Backlog management", 2x "self-managing", 2x "self-management", and "They [the Scrum Team] are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work." So it's also valid to say that Scrum does not provide any guidance on how to organize yourself beyond the Scrum Team.

That doesn't leave much power for the scrum master. They're left with the power over ceremonies: scrum events and workshops. While it is possible to exert some power that way, it does leave the scrum master on the sidelines. Not involved in the work itself and not involved with the decisions about the work.



# Scrum masters are not accountable

It's odd to hold the person you hired as scrum expert, accountable for establishing scrum. Especially if self-management. Scrum is very radical. Don't think you want this.

Similar with effectiveness. You're not giving them power. Or only, conversational power. Where does this leave the manager of the team?

So much value in the old Scrum book: a Scrum Master is a manager.
*"Agile Software Development with Scrum"* (2002) by Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle

# (extra) The scrum master quadrants

Since this whole power/accountability-thing lends itself well to a quadrant model, I went ahead and made one:

# different kinds of power

different kinds of power (French, Raven):

- coercive power,
- reward power
- legitimate or positional
- referent power
- expert power
- informational power


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Raven%27s_bases_of_power

In a notable study of power conducted by social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven in 1959, power is divided into five separate and distinct forms. They identified those five bases of power as coercive, reward, legitimate, referent, and expert. This was followed by Raven's subsequent addition in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.
