Ever since I started working back in 2006, I've used a notebook of some sorts. I didn't have a system, I just wrote things down. Then, about seven years ago, when I became a scrum master, my notebook became more important. As a tester, I could use my team's board to keep track of my work. Now, as a scrum master, none of my work was on the board. And I was supporting two teams. This hasn't changed since, although my role has changed several times since then.

So somewhere along the way - and to be honest I forgot when exactly - I created my own system of note-taking based on bullet journaling. It's simple and straightforward. It helps me plan my day, list possible future actions, and keep a record of what I've been doing. I've never written about it before, perhaps it seems too small and too simple. But it has been a major help in how I structure my days, which does make it worth sharing.

# My note-taking system

My note-taking system is basically a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/)[^2]. It's a notebook. There are two kinds of things in it: a monthly spread and daily entries. And at the start of the notebook there's a third thing: an index to keep track of what's where. I've found it helpful to at least track the monthly spreads and the months of the daily entries.

[^2]: If you want to learn more about the official Bullet Journal method, these two videos are a great start: [*"How to Bullet Journal"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) and [*What is The Bullet Journal Method?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4kueYhGEc8). Both are by the creator of the method, [Ryder Carroll](https://www.rydercarroll.com/).

## The monthly spread

At the start of every month[^1] I make a new monthly spread. It consists of two pages. On the right page of the monthly spread I collect feedback I get during the month. The left page has a list of things I might do. It's not a plan or a commitment. It's a list of options for that month, nothing more. The first time you create this spread, you might have some idead already or it might start out empty and you fill it as the month progresses. Either will work. Then, at the start of each next month, you go through the previous month's list. If you did something but forgot to mark it as done, do it now. Then for the remaining items, you decide to either copy the item to the new spread, or to drop it and forget about it.

[^1]: To be perfectly honest, I don't do this every month. I do take a moment at the start of every month to decide if I should create a new spread or just use the current one for another month.

## The daily entries

At the start of each day I create a daily entry. I write the date and draw a rectangle around it, so that it stands out. I list my meetings of the day and the other things I plan to work on that day. Often enough some unforeseen work pops up during the day, so that gets added to the entry of that day as well.

## The symbols

Both in the monthly spreads and the daily entries, I use a symbol to capture the status of an item. Everything starts with a vertically centered dot in front of it, which means I haven't done it yet. When something is done, I draw an "X" over that dot. If I didn't get to it and it moves to the next day or next monthly spread, I draw a ">" over the dot. If I worked on something, but it's not finished yet, I draw a "+". If I decide that I won't do something at all, I will strikethrough the entry. Finally, if I need to remind myself something is very important, I'll add an exclamation mark in fron of the entry.

## What's not in my work notebook

There are some things I would put in my work notebook, if I didn't prefer having them in my personal notebook (also s bullet journal). Notes from trainings and conferences. My daily journaling entries. Notes for the work-related books I read.

The system remains the same, though. The daily journaling (in the periods when I actually do it) I do at the end of the day, so those would go at the end of the daily entries. The notes from conferences and books get added similarly to the monthly spread. Go to the next empty page, write a title at the top, and add an entry to the index.

What I've also found useful is to draw a symbol in the bottom corner of the page for these entries. It's easier to identify a page as containing notes about a book if there's a small drawing of a book at the bottom of the page. And if I need to start a new page, but there are pages of other stuff in between, I draw an arrow and write the page number of the old page on the new page and vice versa. That way I can browse through all the notes on a particular book without having to go back-and-forth to the index.

## The experience matters

Another aspect that's important - at least to me - is the experience of using the notebook. I want the physical act of adding things to it, marking things as done, etc to be pleasant. For me that means using a hardcover dotted A5 notebook and writing in it with a fountain pen.

It's not just about a nice experience, though. There are also some pracitical reasons.

That it needs to be a hardcover notebook is a remnant from when I still worked at an office instead of remotely. Hardcover means I can easily write in it, without needing a table. For example when sitting in comfortable chairs during a 1-to-1. And a notebook and not a laptop, because a laptop has always felt to me as a barrier between me and the other people. I don't have that feeling with a notebook.

Those considerations became invalid since I started working remotely three years ago. I have thought about moving to a digital notebook, but I don't expect I ever will. For one, I just really like having a physical notebook and writing with a fountain pen. For some reason, I also prefer to have my notebook not on my computer screen, i.e. where all my work is. And finally, I've noticed that I find it easier to keep listening and thinking while I write by hand than while I type on a keyboard.


# What I like about my system

A lot of what I like about my system comes straight from its inspiration: bullet journaling. As Ryder Carroll, its creator, writes in [*"The Bullet Journal Method"*](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/book):

> The Bullet Journal method's mission is to help us become mindful about how we spend our two most valuable resources in life: our time and our energy. [...] How does it do this? By weaving together productivity, mindfulness, and intentionality into a framework that is flexible, forgiving, and most importantly, practical. (p 15)

That may sound like a lot, but in my experience it's true.

## It's practical
It's practical, because you can just write stuff down. It's always clear where to add what, so there's no decision-making before you can start adding a note. You don't have to plan out pages. If you want to start something new, take the next blank one, add it to the index, done. The symbols to keep track of status are straightforward. The system does a great job providing structure while also not gettig in your way.

## It's forgiving
Both the monthly spread and the daily entries are for options, things that you might do. Most of the things that end up in my daily entries I actually complete that day or over the next few days. But sometimes I just keep moving a task over to the next day and the next and the next... And my monthtly spread always fills up quite quickly with more stuff I can possibly do in a month. And the great thing is that that's ok.

Every time you start a new daily entry or a new monthly spread, you get the opportunity to reflect. To apply that mindfulness and intentionality Ryder Carroll talks about and decide: do I want to keep this option in my list? Do I want to give it the energy of keeping it around? Or is it fine to just let it go? To decide you're not going to do it and that that's ok.

## It's flexible
Throughout the years my note-taking system has been evolving with me.

Before working remotely I had more notes in my daily entries, mostly meeting notes. These days, those meeting notes are digital and shared. So my daily entries are mostly a list of activities, notes of 1-to-1 chats, and the occassional reflection.

The feedback page of the monthly spread I added only a few months ago. I was still very much searching in my [new role as quality engineer](link://slug/three-lessons-after-three-months-of-quality-engineering), making me doubt myself. Yet I was also getting positive feedback from my colleagues, so I decided to track that in my monthly spread as a reminder to myself.

Using the "+" as a marker that I worked on something, but it's not dine yet, is also a very recent addition. And while writing this blog post, I discoverd that bullet journaling uses a dot for tasks and a circle for events. So I think I'll try using a circle for meetings for a while to see how that goes.


# How it benefits me / What I have used it for / How my notebooks have helped me

structure my days, weeks, months
keeping track of what needs to be done, esp if ticketing system does not cover most

taking notes of meetings, 1:1 prep, etc

start day with planning the day

history of what I've done

overview when principal engineer: what do you do all day
do this several times a week, once a week, etc / categories

useful for performance review

So if this blog post inspires you to start your own bullet journal, I hope you too use its flexibility to create your own system.

make it your own -> practical, flexible, forgiving
