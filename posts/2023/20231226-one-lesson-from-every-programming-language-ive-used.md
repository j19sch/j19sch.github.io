Throughout the years I've used quite a few different programming languages. Twelve to be exact. To be honest though, I am being generous with the meaning of "use". Some of these I've only done coding exercises in. One of them (PHP) I've used for a total of 10 minutes, but that did save the day for a whole team.

The list also made me wonder what I learned from using these programming languages - besides being able to write some code in them. Turns out I did learn some more general lessons.

# perl
  - there's more than one way to do it
  - languages have a personality
  - first principle: "There's more than one way to do it."
  - 2nd principle: "Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible".
  - Perl's function documentation remarks on the variant behavior of built-in functions in list and scalar contexts by saying, "In general, they do what you want, unless you want consistency."https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc
  - https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/
  	- PEP 20 â€“ The Zen of Python
  		- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
		- Although practicality beats purity
		- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

# php
  - sometimes you don't need to know the language

# SQL
  - I only know how to do reads
  - you don't need to know all of it
  - learned from Python but perfect example

# java
  - different paradigms: oop, typed
  - it's clunky/verbose but it works
  - there's lots of things a program language does  / can do
  - be thankful when things are easier, less verbose
  - IDEs for the win

# VBA for Excel
  - documentation matters

# python
  - language design matters
  - list and dict comprehension

# Javascript
  - popularity and quality are two different things
  - it's not great but it is everywhere

# Bash
  - sometimes there isn't a big lesson
  - readability of the language itself matters
  - most useful hobby project
  - I wrote it but don't ask me what it does
    - local hor_scale=`bc -l <<< "scale=2 ; $INTERNAL_XRES / $hor"`
    - I know it calculates the horizontal scaling factor?

# Clojure
  - languages can be different
  - functional programming in Lisp family

# TypeScript
  - design time and run time are not the same

# Lua
  - layer for testability
  - tests have to run inside simulator, because Lua changes and SDK (I think, works well enough)
  - linter needed extension for lua changes

# Rust
  - compiler errors can be great
