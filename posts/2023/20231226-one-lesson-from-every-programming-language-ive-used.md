one lesson from every program language I've ever used

- generous with the meaning of "used", see story about php
- ideally generic lessons, so not about the specific language

<!-- TEASER_END -->


# perl
  - there's more than one way to do it
  - languages have a personality

# php
  - sometimes you don't need to know the language

# SQL
  - I only know how to do reads
  - you don't need to know all of it
  - learned from Python but perfect example

# java
  - different paradigms: oop, typed
  - it's clunky/verbose but it works
  - there's lots of things a program language does  / can do
  - be thankful when things are easier, less verbose
  - IDEs for the win

# VBA for Excel
  - documentation matters

# python
  - language design matters
  - list and dict comprehension

# Javascript
  - popularity and quality are two different things
  - it's not great but it is everywhere

# Bash
  - sometimes there isn't a big lesson
  - readability of the language itself matters
  - I wrote it but don't ask me what it does
    - local hor_scale=`bc -l <<< "scale=2 ; $INTERNAL_XRES / $hor"`
    - I know it calculates the horizontal scaling factor?

# Clojure
  - languages can be different
  - functional programming in Lisp family

# TypeScript
  - design time and run time are not the same

# Lua
  - layer for testability
  - tests have to run inside simulator, because Lua changes and SDK (I think, works well enough)
  - linter needed extension for lua changes

# Rust
  - compiler errors can be great
