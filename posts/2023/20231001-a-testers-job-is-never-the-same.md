Throughout the years I've had many different testing-related roles: tester in a team of testers, tester in an Agile team, test coordinator/manager, principal test engineer, and quality engineer. It's during my [recent time as a quality engineer](link://slug/im-a-quality-engineer-and-im-not-sure-how-i-feel-about-that), that I realized that all testing-related roles are inherently unstable. They require continuous movement across three axes:

- doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others;
- being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team;
- doing your job versus improving the system.

And this continuous movement is not a balancing act. It's not about finding a spot that's dynamically stable for each of these three axes. It's deciding - often multiple times a day - where to position yourself on those three axes, depending on the people you're working with, the activity you're engaging in, and the goal(s) of that activity.

What do I want to say? Why is this interesting?

- continuous dialogue
- methodology / practices of a team are always changing
- praxis? dialogue, judgement, community instead of one true method (objectivism, Archimean base) or whatever / laissez-faire / just get on with it / fake scrum and just write code (relativism) -> Bernstein book
	- process can never compensate for lack of skill (Highsmith, Cockburn)
- working inside and outside of existing structures
	- organizational anarchism
	- rebel
- being like water
	- conversation Maaret 13 Oct 24
	- also knowing when to be firm / be ice / be a vessel
	- discover gaps and decide which to fill
	-> testers as scrum masters, qualiy coaches, etc
- unsolved problem in software development: where to put the testers
	- there are other supporting roles but
		- they are before programming (design, BA)
		- way more developers say they test than say they do design, or BA, or ...
- developer who 'just' happens not to specialize in programming
- ways to look at the three axes
	- screwed if always/mostly on either side; screwed if you do screwed if you don't
	- means to evaluate what you are doing, what is needed of you
	- explain the struggle, the burnouts, etc

		- Burnout is common in tech because...

		- we build invisible stuff for people we never meet.

- we need smarter ways to talk about what we do
	- Maaret's overview
	- no test engineers, no scrum masters
	- roles are for HR -> my post about tester as overloaded variable
- we need smarter ways to talk about what needs doing
	- testing: automated or manual/exploratory
	- what about refinement? what about monitoring and analytics? stategy? deciding what's important? where to focus?



What I had is good, and shallow/old hat to me.

# Doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others

It’s very hard to support others testing without doing any testing yourself. Yet any testing you do, might become your domain, with others leaving it to you to test.


# Being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team
It’s great to be in the same team as the developers and designers and business analysts. It also gets lonely, so you form an informal team with people in a similar role as yours.


# Doing your job versus improving the system
It’s important to do your job, but to do a good job you discover you first have to change the organization a little (or a lot).


# Working inside and outside of the existing structures

So even though your official job description puts you clearly on one end of each axis - for example my quality engineering role was supporting testing by others, being embedded in a team, and doing my job -, you can only make that work by constantly observing and adjusting your actual position on these three axes. You need to work as much inside the existing structures, as around them. That makes these roles challenging and interesting, but often enough also frustrating. And yet, I wouldn’t want it any other way.

# Why I don't expect this to change anytime soon

Can you relate to this balancing act? Do you move more across some dimensions than others? Do you move across different ones? Would making your balancing act(s) explicit improve your collaboration with others?

unsolved problem in software engineering

dynamic along three axes:

- doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others
- being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team
- doing your job versus improving the system

structure: pros and cons of each end of each axis


## from blog post

My experiences as a quality engineer also made me reflect on testing-related roles in general. Throughout my career I’ve been through quite a few of them: tester in a separate testing team, tester in an Agile team, principal test engineer, and as described in this experience report, quality engineer.

I’ve come to the conclusion that they are all inherently unstable. They require a constant balancing act across three axes:

- doing testing yourself versus supporting testing by others;
- being in a separate team versus being embedded in a team;
- doing your job versus improving the system.

## from writing this
They require a constant balancing act across three axes:

This balancing act happens both in the long term and in the short term. In the long term as you change jobs, change companies, develop skills, develop new interests. In the short term as you work with different people, in different areas

In the short term as in a single day you work with different people, in different areas, from different perspectives. ~~Pairing on unit tests with an experienced developer is a very different game from discussing the business and process risks of a feature with a newly joined colleague.~~

This is high-level, not covering exploration, automation, strategy, monitoring. refinement -> different roles/activities someone can cover in a team.

Balancing across three dimensions in testing roles:

- balancing act
- dynamic across three dimensoins
- three axes of trouble
- inherently unstable
