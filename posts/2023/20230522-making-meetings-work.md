Too often I've heard people say: *"On no, not another meeting!"* Usually this means they feel their time at work is split between time in meetings and time in which they do actual work. And to be fair, they have a point. I too have been in plenty of meetings that didn't achieve much of anything. It doesn't have to be this way, however. Meetings can be effective and they can leave you with a real sense of having accomplished something. And in this post I'll share how to make that happen.

AgileTD abstract

Too often I hear people say: ' Oh no, not another meeting!' Usually this implies they feel their time at the office is either time in which they do work or time in which they are in meetings.

And I must say, I have been in meetings that didn't achieve much of anything. However, meetings don't have to be like that. They can be effective and they can leave you with a real sense of having accomplished something.

The first key to making meetings work, is to look at the three critical elements of a good meeting. They will help you decide if if a meeting is the best way to get a particular piece of work done. They will also help you to notice when a meeting is going off-track. The second key is to approach meetings with the right mindset. To describe this mindset, I will be building on the three core human capacities as identified by Carol Sanford. Which leads me to the third part of this talk: with these capacities being closely related to leadership, making meetings work better is an excellent way to start developing your leadership skills.

So in this talk I will not be sharing tips, tricks and techniques to improve your meetings. Instead I will talk about what you need to make those techniques work. And I will show how participating in meetings with a focus on making them work, is a great way to develop your leadership skills.

# We know how to do meetings

Interestingly, we do know how to do meetings. Here's one of my favorite pieces of advice on meetings:

> *If a meeting is essential, it will have an agenda. It will have minutes. It will have a list of action items, and someone will manage them so that people are accountable for their action items.*  
- [Modern Management Made Easy](https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy) by [Johanna Rothman](https://www.jrothman.com/)

And yet, how many meetings you were in this week, actually lived up to this description?

Or, if you prefer a different benchmark, have they lived up to any of these tips on effective meetings:

- [Tips for better remote meetings](https://mailchi.mp/estherderby/control-creativity-4346163?e=567226f272) by Esther Derby
- [IDOARRT](https://www.idoarrt.com/) meeting design tool
- [Summary of "Do We Really Need Another Meeting?"](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1317491842204766208) by [Ethan Mollick](https://twitter.com/emollick)
- [Tips for running a meeting](https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks/status/1317209544284639232) by [@tef_ebooks](https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks)
- [Notes on effective meetings](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031215331/https://testretreat.com/2019/12/02/effective-meetings/) by [Daniel Carral](https://twitter.com/dcarral)

Obviously the problem is not a lack of guidelines and techniques. It's also not a matter of trying harder next time. We need to do something different, if we want something better. I think that something different is two things: we're missing a good heuristic[^1] of what a meeting is, and we're missing the right attitude to make meetings work.

[^1]: I could have also said "definition" instead of "heuristic". The reason why I prefer "heuristic" over "definition" might be the topic of a future, very philosophical post.



# What is a meeting?

A meeting is __synchronous collaboration with a purpose__.

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-5">
		<figure class="figure">
			<img src="/images/2023/making-meetings-work/venn-meeting.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
			alt="Venn diagram of synchronous, collaboration, and purpose, with meeting at the center"/>
			<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">What is a meeting?</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-7">
			<p>It's <em>synchronous</em>. We're in a shared space at the same time, together.</p>
			<p>There's <em>collaboration</em>. The participants in the meeting are interacting with each other.</p>
			<p>It has a <em>purpose</em>. At the end of the meeting we want to have achieved something. We may fail and that's ok.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
	</div>
</div>

[^2]: Arguably a meeting without a purpose cannot fail, because the only thing it needs to do, is to take place. And yet, those are the meetings that feel the most like a failure afterwards.

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-8">
			<p>If a meeting doesn't need to be <em>synchronous</em>, it could have been an email. Or a Slack message. Or any other form of asynchronous communication or collaboration.</p>
			<p>If a meeting doensn't need any <em>collaboration</em>, it's a speech. It's one-way communication.</p>
			<p>If a meeting doesn't need a <em>purpose</em>, it's a game. Not that games and play don't serve a purpose, but what you do and create in the game, does not have a purpose outside the game.</p>

## You are already doing this

What's interesting to me is that, some of your meetings are like this already. Your daily standup, your retrospective, a brainstorm session. They are synchronous collaboration with a purpose - or at least, I hope they are. They are meetings in which you do the work of coordinating, reflecting, coming up with new ideas.

And you can take this idea of doing your work in meetings a lot further, to where all your work happens in a 'meeting', i.e. ensemble or mob programming.

> *With Mob Programming, our entire day is a working meeting, and more like a workshop than a meeting. We are working together, not merely "meeting".*  
- [Mob Programming](https://leanpub.com/mobprogramming) by Woody Zuill and Kevin Meadows

There are no meetings, there is no work. It's all workshop.


# The need for artful participation

So problem solved? Remind yourself that a meeting should be synchronous collaboration with a purpose and you'll only have perfect meetings from now on?

Unfortunately, no. It's good to have it as a heuristic, but something else is needed as well. Leadership. Or as [Sociocracy 3.0](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/what-is-s3.html) puts it, [artful participation](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/artful-participation.html): *"Is my behavior in this moment the greatest contribution I can make to the effectiveness of this collaboration?"*


## Meetings are something that happens to us

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8">
			<p style="margin-top:10px">A meeting will never be a good meeting if we experience it as something that happens to us, as something that's imposed on us.</p>
			<p>In his book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/330616/orbiting-the-giant-hairball-by-gordon-mackenzie/">"Orbiting The Giant Hairball"</a> Gordon Mackenzie tells the story of how he facilitated a brainstorm session for a task force, after sitting through the incredibily boring and unengaging first part of their meeting. He started with an exercise, using candles and a pair of Tibetan cymbals, to help the attendees let go of their notions and biases of where they thought the meeting would or should go. Thanks to that exercise, the brainstorm proceeded in a completely different way than the previous part of the meeting:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><em>Release from their inculcated culture allowed the task force members to metamorphize - for a little while - from mere attendants at a meeting into vibrant participants in an evolving endeavor. (p206)</em></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Isn't that how all meetings should be? Not with attendants, but with participants in an envolving endavor?</p>

## Leadership and the three core human capabilities

In her book [No More Feedback](https://carolsanford.com/no-more-feedback-cultivate-consciousness-at-work/) Carol Sanford describes three core human capabilities and how they ideally should be developed.

### internal locus of control
Internal locus of control means that you feel control over your own life. You take accountability of outcomes and direction.

### external scope of considering
External scope and considering means that you take other people and living beings into account in your actions and endavours.

### personal source of agency
Personal source of agency means that you feel that you yourself have the authority to initiate actions and to follow through.

It's these capabilities we need to truly participate in a meeting. They prevent us from making the organizer or facilitator solely responsible for the success of the meeting. From only focusing on what we need to get out of the meeting. They encourage us to be skilfull participants. To display leadership during meetings. Not leadership as in taking charge and running the show, but leadership in the way Jerry Weinberg described it:

> creating an environment where everyone can contribute to solving the problem.

Improving meetings starts with small acts of leadership.



# Improve your meetings by starting where you are

GeePaw Hill once [said](https://twitter.com/GeePawHill/status/1290316340369203201):

> *Why do people have long breakless meetings, when everyone in the room dislikes it, and everyone in the room knows it doesn't work very well?*

If that is true, it doesn't take a lot to change it. A small spark is probably enough. And often a small spark, acting as a catalyst, is better than swooping in with a big change. Start where you are - as an individual, as a team, as an organization. Change can be uncomfortable, but it should always be safe.

To close off this post, I want to share some examples of things I've done in the past, to improve a meeting. I've split them in three categories: attending to time, to structure, and to people.


## Attending to time

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-8">
		<p><strong>25 or 50 minute meeting:</strong> set the times on your invite so there's time for a break after and stick to those times</p>
		<p><strong>decline a meeting:</strong> if you don't need to be there, if attending doesn't seem useful, don't go</p>
		<p><strong>suggest a break:</strong> observe the energy in the room and at the right time, suggest a short break</p>
		<p><strong>leave the meeting:</strong> if a meeting turns out not be useful for you, excuse yourself and leave</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<figure class="figure">

			alt="La persistencia de la memoria by Dalí"/>
			<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">La persistencia de la memoria by Dalí</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
</div>

## Attending to structure

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-9">
		<p><strong>ask to zoom in:</strong> if someone is sharing their screen and it's hard or even just uncomfortable to read, ask them to zoom in</p>
		<p><strong>write/draw and share:</strong> if there's a lot of conversation without notes or diagrams, start making them and share them as you make them</p>
		<p><strong>ask for a document upfront:</strong> ask if you can do anything to prepare for the meeting, e.g. reading a document</p>
		<p><strong>move a chair, open a window:</strong> improve the space the meeting is held in, make it more pleasant</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-3">
		<figure class="figure">

			alt="Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow by Mondriaan"/>
			<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow by Mondriaan</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

</div>

## Attending to people

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-8">
		<p><strong>amplify others:</strong> words here</p>
		<p><strong>give credit:</strong> words here</p>
		<p><strong>express appreciation:</strong> words here</p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<figure class="figure">

Locus of control is the "degree to which we experience and exercise control over our own lives, particularly on the direction of our self-development and our reslience to adversity".


- internal locus of control
- external scope of considering
- personal source of agency

accountability others initiative

locus of control: degree to which we experience and exercise control over our own lives, particularly on the direction of our self-development and our reslience to adversity
spectrum: external (our lives determined by others) vs taking accountability of outcomes and direction

scope of considering: what we take into account in our actions and endeavors, especially in relation to other people and living beings (self-centered vs systems-actualizing)
spectrum: only ourselves versus others in our world and other forms of life

source of agency: where we find authority for our initiative and actions (authority of others to direct us vs within us the will to initiate action and follow through)
spectrum: authoritarian worldview versus stepping up and making a difference



Or Jocko Willink: extreme ownership, cover & move, extreme ownership / default aggressive / get after it
