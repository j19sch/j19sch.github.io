Too often I've heard people say: *"On no, not another meeting!"* Usually this means they feel their time at work is split between time in meetings and time in which they do actual work. And to be fair, they have a point. I too have been in plenty of meetings that didn't achieve much of anything. It doesn't have to be this way, however. Meetings can be effective and they can leave you with a real sense of having accomplished something. And in this post I'll share how to make that happen.

AgileTD abstract

Too often I hear people say: ' Oh no, not another meeting!' Usually this implies they feel their time at the office is either time in which they do work or time in which they are in meetings.

And I must say, I have been in meetings that didn't achieve much of anything. However, meetings don't have to be like that. They can be effective and they can leave you with a real sense of having accomplished something.

The first key to making meetings work, is to look at the three critical elements of a good meeting. They will help you decide if if a meeting is the best way to get a particular piece of work done. They will also help you to notice when a meeting is going off-track. The second key is to approach meetings with the right mindset. To describe this mindset, I will be building on the three core human capacities as identified by Carol Sanford. Which leads me to the third part of this talk: with these capacities being closely related to leadership, making meetings work better is an excellent way to start developing your leadership skills.

So in this talk I will not be sharing tips, tricks and techniques to improve your meetings. Instead I will talk about what you need to make those techniques work. And I will show how participating in meetings with a focus on making them work, is a great way to develop your leadership skills.

# We struggle with meetings

			<p style="margin-top:10px">We struggle with meetings. On the one hand we keep proposing them, scheduling them, attending them. On the other hand we keep complaining about them. We feel sorry for people with a day full of meetings. When a meeting ends early, we <em>"give you 10 minutes of your life back"</em>.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>If you feel you do all your work outside of meetings, you're meeting wrong.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>It's something I realized while I was a scrum master: my work happens during meetings. Mostly team meetings and 1-to-1s. There's prep before and follow-up after meetings, but the core of my job was happending during those meetings.</p>

# We know how to do meetings

Interestingly, we do know how to do meetings:

> *"If a meeting is essential, it will have an agenda. It will have minutes. It will have a list of action items, and someone will manage them so that people are accountable for their action items."*  
- [Modern Management Made Easy](https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy) by [Johanna Rothman](https://www.jrothman.com/)

And yet, how many meetings you were in this week actually lived up to this?

Or have lived up to any of these tips on effective meetings:

- [Tips for better remote meetings](https://mailchi.mp/estherderby/control-creativity-4346163?e=567226f272) by Esther Derby
- [IDOARRT](https://www.idoarrt.com/) meeting design tool
- [Summary of "Do We Really Need Another Meeting?"](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1317491842204766208) by [Ethan Mollick](https://twitter.com/emollick)
- [Tips for running a meeting](https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks/status/1317209544284639232) by [@tef_ebooks](https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks)
- [Notes on effective meetings](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031215331/https://testretreat.com/2019/12/02/effective-meetings/) by [Daniel Carral](https://twitter.com/dcarral)

Obviously the problem is not a lack of information, guidelines, or techniques. It's also not a matter of reminding ourselves and trying harder next time. We need to do something different, if we want something better. I think that something different is two things: we're missing a good heuristic[^1] of what a meeting is, and we're missing the right attitude to make meetings work.

[^1]: I could have also said "definition" instead of "heuristic". The reason why I prefer "heuristic" over "definition" might be the topic of a future, very philosophical post.



# What is a meeting?

A meeting is __synchronous collaboration with a purpose__.

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-5">
		<figure class="figure">
			<img src="/images/2023/making-meetings-work/venn-meeting.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded"
			alt="Venn diagram of synchronous, collaboration, and purpose, with meeting at the center"/>
			<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">What is a meeting?</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-7">
			<p style="margin-top:10px;">It's <em>synchronous</em>. We're in a shared space at the same time, together.</p>
			<p>There's <em>collaboration</em>. The participants in the meeting are interacting with each other.</p>
			<p>It has a <em>purpose</em>. At the end of the meeting we want to have achieved something. We may fail and that's ok.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
	</div>
</div>

[^2]: Arguably a meeting without a purpose cannot fail, because the only thing it needs to do, is to take place. And yet, those are the meetings that feel the most like a failure afterwards.

<div class="row align-items-center">
	<div class="col-md-8">
			<p style="margin-top:10px">If a meeting doesn't need to be <em>synchronous</em>, it could have been an email. Or a Slack message. Or any other form of asynchronous communication or collaboration.</p>
			<p>If a meeting doensn't need any <em>collaboration</em>, it's a speech. It's one-way communication.</p>
			<p>If a meeting doesn't need a <em>purpose</em>, it's a game. Not that games and play don't serve a purpose, but what you do and create in the game, does not have a purpose outside the game.</p>
