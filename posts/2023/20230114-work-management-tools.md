# Intro

Affordances and signifiers of our work management tools

<!-- TEASER_END -->

# Affordances

The Design of Everyday Things (revised and expanded) by Donald A. Norman



> An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. (p 11)

> The notion of affordance and the insights it provides originated with J. J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist [...] (p 12)

> But just as I appropriated *affordance* to use in design in a manner somewhat different than its inventor had intended, [...] (p 14)

> Perceived affordances help people figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions. I call the signalling component of affordances *signifiers*. (p 13)

> The first edition of this book introduced the term *affordances* to the world of design. (p 13)

> "Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both." (p 14)

> Affordances represent the possibilities in the world for how an agent (a person, animal,or machine) can interact with something. Some affordances are perceivable, others are invisible. Signifiers are signals. (p 18)

> "To summarize:
>
> - Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not.
> - Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.
> - Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function."" (p 19)

# Maaret

A No Jira Experiment
https://visible-quality.blogspot.com/2022/12/a-no-jira-experiment.html

What if not break down epics into stories in advance?
Need someone like Maaret to come up with and try it. Goes against 20+ years of agile.


# Our tools and us

> We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us. (Emerson Brown, misquoting Winston Churchill)

# Examples

- Teams vs Slack
- Twitter vs Mastodon
- title vs description vs comments
- assign to one, to many, to team
- burn-up versus burn-down chart
- dashboards, what metrics, what data
	- reports and graphs and dashboards
	- TFS pass/fail report: we don't care
- epics -> stories -> tasks
	- old-school work breakdown structure, kinda waterfall, although slices are more vertical
- all the extra fields
	- from managing work to capturing information / documentation
	- to do list and done list and journal and documentation
	- huge backlogs, afraid to delete stuff -> EZ post
- should it be easy to manage a large backlog?
	- Weinberg story about bug db performance

# Work management becoming the work
- managing the work versus managing the work (working the management?)
- one is managing the actual work, the other is managing the work artefacts

> Creating users stories is a very common practice in Agile software development. They were first coined in 1998 by Alistair Cockburn (one of the great minds who signed the Agile Manifesto). In his own words, “A user story is a promise for a conversation.”.

> Back in 1998 Alistair Cockburn, the co-author of the Agile Manifesto, coined the phrase: “A user story is a promise for a conversation”

## Stories
> Give stories short names in addition to a short prose or graphical description. Write the stories on index cards and put them on a frequently-passed wall. - p 45, Extreme Programming Explained 2nd ed, Kent Beck with Cynthia Andres

p 40 idealized story wall with statuses: Done, This Week, This Release, To Be Estimated, Future

### The art of agile development 2nd ed, James Shore

> *Stories* are for planning. They're the playing pieces of the planning game. That's it! Alistair Cockburn calls them "promissory notes for future conversations." (p 13)

> Because stories are just a reminder to have a conversation, the don't need to be detailed. (p 130)

> The card  isn't meant to be a requirements document. (p 130)

> Finally, another common change is to track stories in a spreadsheet, or issue tracking tool, rather than on index cards. That can make a list of stories easier to read, but it makes visualizations and collaboration more difficult. It's a net loss that's hard to appreciate without experience. Give cards at least three months before trying alternatives. Even if your team is remote, use virtual index cards on your virtual whiteboard rather than a spreadsheet or issue tracking tool. (p 138)


## Leaving money on the table

the tool is a commodity (Wardley mapping) -> the practices become too -> no competitive advantage

should you? depends, but Accelerate convincing point of how crucial it is to be good at sw dev


> Should I write a blog post about companies leaving money on the table by not leveraging their choice of work management tool (Jira, Shortcut, etc) as a competitive advantage?
