At the end of my first week at my last job, I published a Notion page that started with:

> Inspired by ["The agile comms handbook"](https://agilecommshandbook.com/) I’m experimenting with a __weekly (internal) blog__. No big promises on the content, just the things I feel like writing about at the end of my week. And as this is an experiment, things might change along the way.

> Please feel free to add a __comment, respond__ to other people's comments and/or __share__ with others!

Only recently I discoverd that Giles Turnbull, author of the book, has written about weeknotes back in 2020: ["Tips for writing good weeknotes"](https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html)

In this post, I'll briefly tell the story of my 8 month-experiment with weekly notes. After that, I'll share some tips in case you want to try this too.

# The story of my experiment with weekly notes

## The start

I had read the ["The agile comms handbook"](https://agilecommshandbook.com/) in December 2021 and was intrigued by Giles Turnbull's idea of "working in the open". In August of 2022 I started a new job at an all-remote company, supporting two teams as a quality engineer.[^1] This seemed the perfect opportunity to experiment with writing a short weekly blog post and sharing it with my colleagues, i.e. weekly notes.

[^1]: I'm not going to go into much detail about the job here. If you're interested, see my experience report [*"I'm a quality engineer and I'm not sure how I feel about that"*](link://slug/im-a-quality-engineer-and-im-not-sure-how-i-feel-about-that).

It felt a bit daunting to start this experiment in my very first week at a new job, but I also thought it would be really cool to have this weekly notes right from the start. So I wrote the first one on Friday 26 August 2022 and shared it with my direct colleagues: my manager, the developers in the two teams I'd support, the two product managers, the UX designer, the department's staff engineer, and my fellow quality engineers.


## What I wrote about

Quite quickly I found a basic structure that worked for me: three topics, three paragraphs, each paragraph with a clear focus. Often enough I would divert from that structure, but it would give me a place to start: "What three things do I want to share this week?" Once I started writing, I'd decide if I wanted to write about a single topic but longer, or if I wanted to add a fourth paragraph, etc.

As to content, looking back through my Weekly Notes, there were three recurring threads:

- stories about what I did with reflections and lessons learned along the way
- mentions of interesting heuristics (e.g. "What if there are 0 / 1 / several / lots of this thing?"), blog posts, videos, ...
- celebrations of people who helped me or did something awesome

A thing I caught myself doing - luckily well before publishing -, was wanting to continue a discussion I was having with a colleague through my Weekly Notes. I'm glad I realized in time that nothing positive would come out of that. Every next post I wrote, I checked to make sure I wouldn't fall into that trap. focus on something positive


## Who read them

The short answer to who read my Weekly Notes is: not many people. There was interest at the start, when I shared that I was starting to write these Weekly Notes. In the next few months some people came back occassionally. And people I mentioned would often visit my Weekly Notes' Notion page.

The only peole who read my Weekly Notes on a regular basis, though, were my manager and our principal quality engineer. The principal quality engineer was also the only person who regularly added a comment to my posts. (If not to every post, he came very close. I really appreciated that.) Then in February 2023 layoffs were announced and unfortunately he was impacted.A reorg would also go into effect in March, so my manager would no longer be my manager. This led me to reflect on what I wanted from my weekly notes and eventually to decide to stop writing them.


## The end

On Friday 7 April 2023 I decided to stop with my weekly notes and wrote my 29th and last one:

> I’ve __decided to stop__ writing these Weekly Notes. No one is reading them anymore. I’m not sure what their __purpose__ is, so I’m also not sure why people would be __interested__ in reading them. If I want to __journal__, I can do that in a notebook, without having to be aware of people potentially reading what I write.

> If I ever start again, I’ll do that here, or at least drop a link.




# Tips if you want to start writing weekly notes

Even though my story isn't one of overwhelming success, I still hope some of you will give writing weekly notes a try. I learned from writing them (similar to journaling) and I learned about what works and what doesn't in weekly notes.

So if you want to give weekly notes a go, here are some tips based on my experiences.

__Keep it short.__ I aimed to write my weekly notes in 30 minutes. It took some practice, but in the end I managed to write them within that timeslot most of the time. Using 3-topics-in-3-paragraphs as a starting point helped me to do so. You could also start with 2-topics-in-2-paragraphs. Or only 1 for that matter.

__Write, then edit.__ Write a paragraph, then edit or even rewrite it. Don't start writing a paragraph, then edit it, continue writing, return to editing, etc. As you write, you discover what you want to write. So do that first, then edit and/or rewrite.[^2]

__Use highlighting.__ Not everyone will be interested in everything you write about. Use highlighting (or titles) so people can scan a paragraph and decide if they want to read it.

__Be open.__ Share your thoughts and feelings, share the in-between steps you usually don't. Share your struggles, share how and what you've been learning. Of course, this assumes you're working in an environment where it's safe to do so.

__Keep it positive.__ No continuing of discussions, no complaining, no teaching in a condescending way. That is not to say your weekly notes should be all sunshine and rainbows. Far from it, but the core message should be something like: This is interesting, this is cool, this is intriguing, this is fun, etc. Not: this is dumb, this sucks.

__Read the room.__ If big things are happening in the organization, take that into account. For example, when the February layoffs were announced, I wrote a single sentence for my Weekly Notes: "Sad week, people are being laid off."

__Keep notes throughout the week.__ This also helps with the work itself[^3], but being able to scan through your notes of the past week, makes it a lot easier to decide what you'd like to write about in yout weeklt notes.

__Respond to engagement.__ If someone comments on your weekly notes, respond. At least acknowledge and thank them
say "Thank you for reading my weekly notes!"

__Reflect and adjust.__ Think about what you want to achieve with your weekly notes. What's working and what isn't? What are some things you'd like to try and do differently?

__Have courage.__  ok to feel self-conscious, takes a bit of arrogance, pay attention to tone, how to advertise, etc

Last but not least, I recommend reading Giles Turnbull's [tips on weeknotes](https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html) and his [Agile comms book](https://agilecommshandbook.com/). After all, his book is what inspired me to try out writing weekly notes.

# questions I still have
- what's the purpose?
	- sharing! then see what happens

nothing of interest below this line

# Tips of you want to start doing this
- don't continue discussions with people in your notes
- highlight key words for fast decission: read or not
- sensitive to the environment
	- Week of 30 January ‘23 (#21): Sad week, people are being laid off.
- 30 minutes max (I found that hard)
- will take time to build audience
- notes help to know what to write about -> my note taking system for work

- topics:
	- what working on
	- celebrate others
	- conferences etc
	- blog posts
	- teach (did that only at the beginning, e.g. about ET)
	- figuring out my role (link to other two posts)
	- highlight All Hands contents
	- reflections on the work
	- investigate a prod issue: Week of 7 November ‘22 (#10)
	- share the 'ugly' parts, not just success stories
	- random stuff I learned about the SF-OP integration: Week of 9 January ‘23 (#18)
- great way to celebrate others (assuming it's read)
- share what you're learning, what you're figuring out, where you're struggling/stuck
- read Giles Turnbull's tips https://gilest.org/weeknotes-tips.html and book https://agilecommshandbook.com/
- ok to feel self-conscious, takes a bit of arrogance, pay attention to tone, how to advertise, etc

- great way to celebrate others (assuming it's read)

- positive: no continuing discussions, no complaining, no teaching, no condescending; not just the pretty stuff
- highlight (color, bold) so readers can quickly decide if they want to read or just scan
- be aware of context: layoffs in Feb just a single line 
- write - edit cycle helps, Johanna Rothman’s book: write - cycle - write - … - edit; just start writing ->  by Johanna Rothman
- keep it short, take 30 mins to write (I struggled with it)
	- 3 topics (core points), 3 paragraphs, no digressions
	- each paragraph with a clear focus
	- 3 topics, 3 paragraphs, each one core idea

- work in the open: the process, the ugly bits, things you learned/discovered, the struggles
	- mindful of privilege, assumes safe enough environment

---

topics 2:
- working in the open: stories about what I did, include the ugly parts, e.g. figuring out my role. include reflections, learned stuff
- celebrate others
- mention heuristics (e.g. "What if there are 0 / 1 / several / lots of this thing?") and links to interesting stuff (blog posts, conferences)
- what working on
- figuring out my role (link to other two posts)
- celebrate others
- reflections on the work
- investigate a prod issue: Week of 7 November ‘22 (#10)
- share the 'ugly' parts, not just success stories
- random stuff I learned about the SF-OP integration: Week of 9 January ‘23 (#18)
- conferences etc
- blog posts
- teach (did that only at the beginning, e.g. about ET)
- highlight All Hands contents

# notes

- don't use it to talk back to people, no subtweeting
- start small
- highlighting
- giving credit
- respond to comments
- no teaching or preaching or subtweeting or commenting, yes informing sharing
- 3 paragraphs, 3 topics, so focus no extras
- write it in 30 minutes
- more readers than responders (or sharers?)

## Three lessons after three months of quality engineering

> I've also started an experiment: writing a weekly internal blog. The inspiration came from [Giles Turnbull](https://gilest.org/)'s [*"The agile comms handbook"*](https://agilecommshandbook.com/) and its idea of *"working in the open"*. Every Friday I take 30 minutes to write three paragraphs about my past week. It's still an experiment-in-progress, but it's been successful enough after six posts that I decided to stick with it. At some point I should probably dedicate a full post to this experiment.

## I'm a quality engineer and I'm not sure how I feel about that
