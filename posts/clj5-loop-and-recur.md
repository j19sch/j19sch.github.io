Yet again it's been a while since I did some Clojure or blogged about it. This time I'm writing this blog post
three months after working on the code on September 5, 6 and 12. I'm not going to dwell on that too long, because
other things in my life were more important. I did feel a little sad when this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
launched and I realized my Clojure is nowhere near a state where I could attempt the puzzles. So I ended up doing
the first 10 days in Python, which is twice as far as I got last year.

I also feel like my current approach to learning lends itself well enough to going slow. Taking my time to play around
and make notes with while working through a section of [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/)
and then revisiting my code and notes later to write a blog post, does seem to result in stuff actually sticking in my memory.
(Disclaimer: am writing this before writing the rest of this blog post.) Slow is smooth and smooth is fast, as they say.

The section I tackled in September is "Pulling It All Together" from Chapter 3, which describes the construction of a 
piece of code of about 50 lines.

# notes

wrote it in Python, but where is it?
	-> did not commit & push from my other machine?

Not sure how to evaluate (load) the whole file.
vim cheatsheet, vim-fireplace page, also on cheatsheet

appreciate functional style trying to re-figure out what the code does
yay shift+k

<!-- TEASER_END -->

## loop and recur
One thing that confused me was `into` and `conj`.
surprised looking back on it
related to looper and other-loop and set-looper  and looper1 -> loop/recur


## comparing with python
how would I write in in Python?
more functional style?
