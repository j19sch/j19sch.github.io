At the second [FroGS conf Open Space](https://frogsconf.nl/) on 12 March 2022 I facilitated a session based on my blog post ["Four skills to embody the four Agile values"](link://slug/four-skills-to-embody-the-four-agile-values). After a short summary of that post, I asked the participants in the session to think about what they value in the context of Agile. Then I invited them to list skills related to Agile and what they value. Finally we exlpored two skills deeper "listening" and "technical excellence", where I encouraged the group to think of increasingly smaller and more concrete subs-skills of these two.

# What we value

When I prepared the Miro board for my session, I first labeled this part "values". Then I remembered I had decided earlier to label it "what we value", so as to avoid the discussion about what values are and aren't. The topic did come up (the relation between values, ethics and morals), so I was glad I could easily respond by saying it's a great topic, but not for this session.

We ended up with 28 stickies of things we value. Clustered by me for this post and in no particular order, these look like this:

- focus on business value, to talk to the users, outcomes over output, results
- self-organization, autonomy, collaboration
- people with skills
- humanity
- trust, open for discussion, brainstorming, motivate each other, share goals
- flexibility, being flexible with changes
- fun
- art, creativity (x2), beauty/elegance, simplicity
- quality
- knowledge, learning, continuous improvement, feedback
- showing progress, transparency

My initial idea was to have participants draw arrows from the things they value to the skills. Early on in the session I realized that would get very messy (and not in a helpful way), so I dropped the idea. This reduced the "what we value"-part to a warm-up exercise. I think it's valuable to do something like it, instead of dropping straight into the skills part, but it could also be something different. For example, asking the participants for stories about daily standup meetings and then during the skilks-part focus on the ones relevant to the daily standup.

# Skills
After a few miunutes we had 13 stickies with skills:

- collaboration
- ability to compromise
- leadership
- taking ownership, asking ownership
- apply thinking from different angles
- vulnerability
- bravery
- do good enough and kill perfectionism
- abstraction
- visualisation
- communication
- technical excellence

The first skill we looked deeper into was "communication". Very quickly someone mentioned the sub-skill of "listening" and that become our focus. The second skill we examined, was "technical excellence". I'm glad we went with a very different kind of skill for the second one.

# Listening

Our exploration of listening looked like this:

As mentioned above we very quickly moved from "communication" to "listening". This prompted someone to share the idea of three levels of listening: applying what you hear to yourself, listening to the person, and listening to the whole context. The second level lead us to explore empathic listening and what is required to do that well, for instance being aware of your own biases. This kept happening throughout the session. We kept identifying more and more skills - and each of those could be examined further still.

During the conversation I kept challenging the participants to come up with smaller and more concrete skills. At one point we got to a level that felt to me as the level where I wanted to get to. A conversation about how to show you are listening, for example through body language, lead to the idea of mirroring the other person. You consciously copy someone's body language to build rapport. Another approach is to use similar analogies and metaphors as the other person.

So at that point we had identified the skill of verbal and non-verbal mirroring as a sub-skill of listening/communication.
-> Why is this the level I wanted to get to?


# Technical excellence

Our exploration of technical excellence looked like this:

Less time than for listening, so fewer stickies

Q: is it only doing or also communicating and collaborating?
Q: what is elegance? how do we recognize it? how do we learn to recognize it? should we study aesthetics and philosophy of art?


# So what now?
what I want to achieve: climbing example, mirroring example

there's too much, so how pair down / generalize (e.g. skill for listening works for tech excellence)

is there a link with "An approach to teaching Agile 20 years after the Agile Manifesto"?
noticing - options - principles
