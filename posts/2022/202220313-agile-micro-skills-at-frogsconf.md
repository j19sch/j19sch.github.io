At the second [FroGS conf Open Space](https://frogsconf.nl/) on 12 March 2022 I facilitated a session based on my blog post [*"Four skills to embody the four Agile values"*](link://slug/four-skills-to-embody-the-four-agile-values). After a short summary of that post, I asked the participants in the session to think about what they value in the context of Agile. Then I invited them to list skills related to Agile and what they value. Finally we exlpored two skills deeper "listening" and "technical excellence", where I encouraged the group to think of increasingly smaller and more concrete subs-skills of these two.


# What we value

When I prepared the Miro board for my session, I first labeled this part "values". Then I remembered I had decided earlier to label it "what we value", so as to avoid the discussion about what values are and aren't. The topic did come up (the relation between values, ethics and morals), so I was glad I could easily respond by saying it's a great topic, but not for this session.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

We ended up with 28 stickies of things we value. Clustered by me for this post and in no particular order, these look like this:

- focus on business value, to talk to the users, outcomes over output, results
- self-organization, autonomy, collaboration
- people with skills
- humanity
- trust, open for discussion, brainstorming, motivate each other, share goals
- flexibility, being flexible with changes
- fun
- art, creativity (x2), beauty/elegance, simplicity
- quality
- knowledge, learning, continuous improvement, feedback
- showing progress, transparency

My initial idea was to have participants draw arrows from the things they value to the skills. Early on in the session I realized that would get very messy (and not in a helpful way), so I dropped the idea. This reduced the "what we value"-part to a warm-up exercise. I think it's valuable to do something like it, instead of dropping straight into the skills part, but it could also be something different. For example, asking the participants for stories about daily standup meetings and then during the skilks-part focus on the ones relevant to the daily standup.


# Skills
After a few miunutes we had 13 stickies with skills:

- collaboration
- ability to compromise
- leadership
- taking ownership, asking ownership
- apply thinking from different angles
- vulnerability
- bravery
- do good enough and kill perfectionism
- abstraction
- visualisation
- communication
- technical excellence

The first skill we looked deeper into was "communication". Very quickly someone mentioned the sub-skill of "listening" and that become our focus. The second skill we examined, was "technical excellence". I'm glad we went with a very different kind of skill for the second one.

# Listening

Our exploration of listening looked like this:

As mentioned above we very quickly moved from "communication" to "listening". This prompted someone to share the idea of three levels of listening: applying what you hear to yourself, listening to the person, and listening to the whole context. The second level lead us to explore empathic listening and what is required to do that well, for instance being aware of your own biases. This kept happening throughout the session. We kept identifying more and more skills - and each of those could be examined further still.

During the conversation I kept challenging the participants to come up with smaller and more concrete skills.  A conversation about how to show you are listening, for example through body language, lead to the idea of mirroring the other person. You consciously copy someone's body language to build rapport. Another approach is to use similar analogies and metaphors as the other person.

At that point I felt we got to the level I wanted to reach. The skill of verbal and non-verbal mirroring is not too broad, which would be the case for the skill "building rapport". It's also not overly specific or narrow, which would be the case for the skill "using similar metaphors".


# Technical excellence

With the time we had left in our session, we explored technical excellence:

![Stickes with technical excellence skills](/images/2022/agile-microskills-frogs/technical-excellence.png)

A discussion that ensued almost immediately was if technical excellence was only about being able to do technically excellent things, or also about communicating about and collaborating on such things. We didn't resolve this. We noted it as a topic of discussion and moved on.

Another interesting question we discovered, but not really answered was: what is elegance? How do you recognize it?	How can you learn to recognize it? Should we start studying [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics)?

One thing I appreciate about both questions is that they came up in a discussion about something you could label as a "hard" skill, i.e. tehcnical excellence. That shows yet again that the distinction between "hard" and "soft" skills has very limited value.


# Where to take this next

To be honest, I'm not sure where to take this next. I still believe in what I wrote about a year ago in my post [*"An approach to teaching Agile 20 years after the Agile Manifesto"*](link://slug/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto):

> "Software development is not an easy problem to solve, let alone teaching the skills that enable you to solve it. But I do believe this approach [noticing - options - principles] has a good chance of helping people to acquire that skill set and to deal confidently and comfortably with whatever situation, team, and organization they find themselves in."

Teaching skills, however, requires a list of skills. And what this session has shown, is that before you know it you have a list of hundreds of skills. And that's too many to be manageable.

At the moment I see two possible solutions to get to a shorter list. One is to focus on skills that are more generally applicable, such as the skill of ["detaching"](link://slug/four-skills-to-embody-the-four-agile-values#detaching) I mentioned in my previous blog post. It's a skill that will serve you well in meetings, but also when testing or writing code.

The other one is to make it an opiniated list. To create it based on certain assumptions and values that then inform the choice of skills. And that opens up the possibility of different styles (or even schools) of Agile software development, defined by different people based on what fits for them.
