K-cards are often used at peer conferences to structure the discussion after someone has presented their experience report. Some people really hate them. In my experience they're a great tool to enable rich conversations. Since the facilitator uses them to structure the conversation in threads, K-cards allow the group to drill down to the details of the experience report. This instead of the conversation jumping around as person 1 broaches topic A, person 2 introduces topic B, and person 3 wants to return to topic A.

The explanation of these K-cards often takes the form of "This is what each card means." instead of "This is when to use this card for what purpose." And despite the elegance of the K-cards system, when you learn about them during the opening of a peer conference, it's a lot of information to digest. So I hope this blog post will be useful as a written explanation of K-cards.

# K-cards?

K-cards are a set of colored cards - at least three (green, yellow, red), sometimes more - given to the participants of a peer conference. Each set also has a unique number written on it to identify its owner. This makes the life of the facilitator easier, since they need to keep track of who raises which card when. They were invented by Paul Holland (except for the actual cards part, ironically) as he describes in *"[The history of K-Cards](https://testingthoughts.com/blog/26)"*.


# Green cards (mostly) after the presentation
After the presenter has shared their experience report, you can raise your green card. It means that you want to introduce a new topic to the discussion. Contributing to an existing discussion topic would be hard, since the discussion hasn't started yet. If you have multiple topics, you can raise your green card multiple times.

Good topics explore the content of the experience report further. You might want to ask a question to get the presenter to elaborate on certain parts of their report. Curiosity is an important skill here. Or you might want to share one of your own experiences that's similar to the presenter's, but perhaps also different in a few aspects. Or you might want to ask the presenter about their thoughts and considerations, or about what if certain aspects of their experience report would have been different. Basically, a good topic is anything that increases the understanding of the people present.

the stack -> a thread according to Paul Holland

After the facilitator has noted down all the green cards, they will select one to go first and the discussion starts. It might of course happen that during the discussion, you come up with a new topic. In that care, raise your green card and the facilitator will add yours to the stack of open cards.


# Yellow cards during the discussion
After the person with a green card asked their question, usually the presenter of the experience report responds. In that sense, the presenter has a unique position: they do not have to raise a card and wait to speak until the facilitator invites them to. If anyone else wants to contribute to the topic (so the topic introduced by the green card), the need to raise their yellow card. The facilitator will note down who raises a yellow card and select one of them to speak.

This is where K-cards get interesting and show their power. A yellow card or the presenter's response to it, might trigger a yellow card from someone else. And so on and so forth. Simon 'Peter' Schrijver has a great blog post of a green card triggering 21 yellow cards in multiple sub-threads: *"[Facilitation : Dealing with the Yellow cards](https://simonsaysnomore.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/facilitation-dealing-with-the-yellow-cards/)"*


# Red cards at any time
Red cards are the least used ones and for a good reason. A red card means you have to speak now and the facilitator will interrupt whoever is speaking, to give you the floor. Some good reasons to raise a red card are:

- you have trouble hearing whoever is speaking
- you're unfamiliar with a term or abbreviation that's key to understanding what's being said
- someone shares something that's factually wrong and that needs to be addressed immediately
- there's some kind of emergency, e.g. "Is that smoke I'm smelling?"

This means the red card can be used both during the presentation of the experience report, as during the discussion that follows.

Since there's a risk of people abusing the red card, for example to make a point in the discussion, the facilitator has the power to take away someone's card in such cases.


# When your card is being covered in a different thread
It might happen that the topic of your green or yellow card gets addressed in a different thread. (Great minds think alike, after all.) Or that a thread comes really close to your topic. In that case you have two options.

The simplest option is to raise your yellow card and share what you want to share when the facilitator asks you to. Later, when the facilitator gets to your original green or yellow card, simply say "Never mind." or something to that effect and the facilitator will move on the next card on their stack. This also works if for whatever reason you no longer want to say what you wanted to say when you raised your card.

The other option is to raise your yellow card and indicate to the facilitator it replaces your other card. If it replaces your green card, you can make a swapping gesture with both cards. In rare occasions, you might want to replace a yellow card with a yellow card. In that case it's best to wait until you get to speak and then gesture to the facilitator to drop your card. A common gesture for this is similar to the ["cut" hand signal as used in broadcasting](https://www.streamsemester.com/articles/floor-director-hand-signals), but with the hand moving back and forth a few times from the wrist. The same gesture works if for whatever reason you no longer want to say what you wanted to say when you raised a green or yellow card.



# The job of the facilitator
the facilitator: notes, decides who speaks when, rarely puts self on the stack

if new to k-cards, don't worry, safe space, facilitators will facilitate, you'll have the hang of it after one discussion

order of speakers is up to facilitator
not every green/yellow card might get to speak
preference for people who have not spoken much yet
structure matters, thread can go 7 deep

avoid long back-and-forth between presenter and single participant (job facilitator)

nod when noted

# Possible improvements to K-cards
- different drop card gesture, because slitting throat
- colors that work for red/green colorblind people
- online tool
