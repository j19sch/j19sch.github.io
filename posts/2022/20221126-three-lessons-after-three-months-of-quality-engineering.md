Three months ago I started a new job supporting two teams as a quality engineer. So far it's been an interesting challenge. The two teams were formed only a few months before I joined, although some team members had been working for the company already. Each team has their own product manager. We also have an engineering manager, but they joined only two weeks before I did. And then I was added to the mix, with a job description that didn't give a lot more guidance then: support the team in things related to testing and quality.

So my first task in my new job was figuring out what my job was. Or rather, figure out what concrete things I could do that fit that job description. This was not made easier by the fact that we're a fully remote company. Not being in the same space throughout the day does make a difference, when you're trying to find your place. The three things that are helping me to do so, are patience, visibility and connections.

# Patience
The first lesson is patience.

things take time
it's not all about you, lots of other things happening


So the past three months have been challening. Mostly in a good way, but sometimes in a frustrating way. For a large part I have myself to blame for that. I had (have) very high expectations of myself, while the main thing I needed was patience. So perhaps that's the fourth lesson beneath the other three: patience, things take time.




# Visibility
When your work is not connected to specific steps in the process, it's easy to become a bit invisible. Not that people forget about you, but you're not top of mind either when people are doing their work. And you're all working remotely, so it's not as if people see you sit at your desk as a reminder that you joined.

## showing that you exist
don't see anyone outside of meetings, join meetings
weekly notes (separate post one day) Agile Comms Handbook, working in the open
be active on Slack: share things, emoji react, reply

## showing what you can do
oh, you looked at the code
reporting some bugs
asking questions during refinement






# Connections and relations
Working remotely means that all communication gets that little extra friction. I notice that the most when it comes to small and casual interactions. It's very hard for them to happen spontaneously as they'd do in an office. So you need to be intentional about them, which can feel a bit awkward.

It's something I struggle with, because even at an office I'm not the greatest at smalltalk. Sometimes it comes naturally, often enough it takes some active effort. So I've always tended to connect with colleagues through doing work together or through having work-related conversations instead. Unfortunately there aren't many opportunities for that if you're all still figuring out how you can contribute to the work.

When I started, I had an introduction chat with everyone. I've started to schedule coffee chats again.

Another thing I try to do, is make conversation as we are waiting for a standup or meeting to start[^1]. Usually people do something else during that time. It's interesting to be the person that joins a meeting and asks a question or tells a story. Because usually I'm not and it costs me energy.

[^1]: There's a special place in hell for people who make their colleagues stare at a "your host has not started the meeting yet" screen instead of letting them talk to each other.

What I find interesting about these four lessons is that none of them have much to do with how good I can test, how well I understand software development, or any of those things. They're about communication and collaboration. It doesn't matter how good my so-called hard skills are, if I don't have the soft skills to find a place where I can make an impact.

What are three things you learned in the past three months? What are the things that form the basis of your success in your current role?

# Scaffolding
I've run a few different workshops in the past three months. One to discuss where I'd fit in the process of one team, a refinement/digramming session, a diagram/risk session.

Throughtout those it became clear I needed to provide more scaffolding in those workshops. Starting with an empty Miro board, some ideas of my own, and the question: how does it work and how will we test it? will not cut it. I don't know enough about the context and the work. I don't know enough about the background of the team members. I don't know what their testing views and skills are. And they don't know how I think about testing or what my skills are.

So plan for things taking time during workshops (am always too optimistic), provide structure, while also leaving space. Try different things. Give space, wait for responses, allow the silence, fill in a little yourself if needed, rinse and repeat.

Be very clear in instructions. Instructions of one activity at a time.


lot of work is invisible to me
missing context of the work, of what people do, of what people know

don't know what people know
take time to prepare (at least as much time as the session-> 20211024-lessons-learned-after-facilitating-elephant-carpaccio)
things take time
provide structure, clarity, etc
next up is this and that, someone responds to that

winging it, leaving a lot of space will not do, although space needed for people to contribute, serendipity, not leading to outcomes fixed before the sesssion
