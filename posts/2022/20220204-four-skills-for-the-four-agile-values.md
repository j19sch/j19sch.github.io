If you're familiar with the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), you're familiar with its four Agile values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Which leaves me with two questions:

- What do each of these mean?
- What skills would you need to embody these values?

# Sharing interpretive labor

>  "Most of us are capable of getting a superficial sense of what others are thinking or feeling just by observing their tone of voice, or body language - it's usually not hard to get a sense of people's immediate intentions and motives, but going beyond the superficial often takes a great deal of work. Much of the everyday business of social life, in fact, consists in trying to decipher others' motives and perceptions. Let us call this "interpretive labor". One might say, those relying on the fear of force are not obliged to engage in a lot of interpretative labor, and thus, generally speaking, they do not." (p66-67)

## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools


# Detachment / Defocusing

## Working software over comprehensive documentation


# Daring greatly

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation


# Flowing with the go

## Responding to change over following a plan


# Closing thoughts
My initial idea for this blog post was to include an updated version of the Agile Manifesto in the format of *"x over y through z"*. That's probably too early. And I'm not sure about either the four values or the four skills.
