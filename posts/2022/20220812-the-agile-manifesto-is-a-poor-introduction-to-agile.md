Last week [Elizabeth Zagroba](https://twitter.com/ezagroba) [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ezagroba/status/1557608861690912772):

> If someone was completely new to working on software on an Agile team, what would you want them to read about Agile first?

My first thought was: "The Agile Manifesto!" After a second thought, though, I reconsidered and [replied](https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1557650105930579968):

> And I would recommend against reading the Agile Manifesto without consulting any secondary sources, except if you read it in the same way as you would visit a historical site "just to see where it all happened".

As I wrote this, I could not really put my finger as to why exactly I felt this way. The best I could come up with was that the Agile Manifesto is hard to understand on its own. You need some historical context and pracitical experience to make sense of it. Conincidentally I'm currently reading ["Seeing Like a State"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State) by [James C. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Scott). In chapter 9 he discusses the Greek concept of *mētis* (μῆτις) and how it relates to rules of thumb. Turns out that this explains why the Agile Manifesto is a poor introduction to Agile.

# Mētis and rules of thumb

In *"Chapter 9. Thin Simplifications and Practical Knowledge: Mētis"* of "Seeing Like a State" James C. Scott explains[^1] mētis like this:

> The concept comes to us from the ancient Greeks. Odysseus was frequently praised for having mētis in abundance and for using it to outwit his enemies and make his way home. Mētis is typically translated into English as "cunning" or "cunning intelligence." While not wrong, this translation fails to do justice to the range of knowledge and skills represented by mētis. __Broadly understood, mētis represents a wide array of practical skills and acquired intelligence in responding to a constantly changing natural and human environment.__ Odysseus's mētis was in evidence, not only in his deceiving of Circe, the Cyclops, and Polyphemus and in binding himself to the mast to avoid the Sirens, but also in holding his men together, in repairing his ship, and in improvising tactics to get his men out of one tight spot after another. The emphasis is both on Odysseus's ability to adapt successfully to a constantly shifting situation and on his capacity to understand, and hence outwit, his human and divine adversaries. *(p. 313) [emphasis mine]*

[^1]: He bases his explanation on "Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society" by Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant, trans. Janet Lloyd (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1978), originally published in French as "Les ruses d’intelligence: La mētis des grecs" (Paris: Flammarion, 1974)

He then explains the relation between mētis and general rules of thumb:

> Even the part of mētis that can be conveyed by rules of thumb is the codification of practical experience. (p. 330) Taking language as a parallel, I believe that the rule of thumb is akin to formal grammar, whereas mētis is more like actual speech. __Mētis is no more derivative of general rules than speech is derivative of grammar.__ *(p. 319) [emphasis mine]*

This means that these general rules of thumb are on their own insufficient for success in practice:

> The generic formula does not and cannot supply the local knowledge that will allow a successful translation of the necessarily crude general understandings to successful, nuanced, local applications. __The more general the rules, the more they require in the way of translation if they are to be locally successful.__ *(p. 318) [emphasis mine]*

Which has James C. Scott asking the question: "Why are the rules of thumb that can be derived from any skilled craft still woefully inadequate to its practice?" He answers as follows:

> Knowing a craft's shorthand rules is a very long way from its accomplished performance: "These rules and principles are mere abridgements of the activity itself; they do not exist in advance of the activity, they cannot properly be said to govern it and they cannot provide the impetus of the activity. A complete mastery of the principles may exist alongside a complete inability to pursue the activity to which they refer, for __the pursuit of the activity does not consist in the application of these principles; and even if it did, the knowledge of how to apply them (the knowledge of actually pursuing the activity) is not given in a knowledge of them__."[^2] *(p. 316) [emphasis mine]*

# The Agile Manifesto as rules of thumb based on mētis




rules of thumb are derived from mētis, they don't teach mētis

the authors as representatives of lightweight methodologies had mētis
Adaptive Software Development
Crystal
Extreme Programming (XP)
Pragmatic Programming (PP)
Scrum


the Manifesto (4 values and 12 principles) are rules of thumb based on their mētis

opening of the Manifesto:
> We are uncovering better ways of developing  
software by doing it and helping others do it.  
Through this work we have come to value:

sharing the rules of thumb (esp. since they are so general, see quote above) is not very helpful



# So how do you introduce someone to Agile?
My [first reply](https://twitter.com/j19sch/status/1557618194927476736), excerpt from James Shore's book

> "First https://jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/what_is_agile to get the big picture, then 'Agile Conversations' by Douglas Squirrel and Jeffrey Fredrick, so they can have good conversations with colleagues about how to agile."

Don't spend too much time on it:

- 70s-80s-90s heavyweight methodologies
- 90s lightweight methodologies
- 2001 Agile Manifesto
- past 20 years lots happened: used, misused, misinterpreted, but also DevOps, Lean
- basically everyone is Agile now, so don't worry about it

# all the quotes in order of appearance in the book
> The concept comes to us from the ancient Greeks. Odysseus was frequently praised for having mētis in abundance and for using it to outwit his enemies and make his way home. Mētis is typically translated into English as 'cunning' or 'cunning intelligence.' While not wrong, this translation fails to do justice to the range of knowledge and skills represented by mētis. Broadly understood, mētis represents a wide array of practical skills and acquired intelligence in responding to a constantly changing natural and human environment. Odysseus's mētis was in evidence, not only in his deceiving of Circe, the Cyclops, and Polyphemus and in binding himself to the mast to avoid the Sirens, but also in holding his men together, in repairing his ship, and in improvising tactics to get his men out of one tight spot after another. The emphasis is both on Odysseus's ability to adapt successfully to a constantly shifting situation and on his capacity to understand, and hence outwit, his human and divine adversaries. (p. 313)

> One powerful indication that they all require mētis is that they are exceptionally difficult to teach apart from engaging in the activity itself. (p.313)

> The skills of mētis may well involve rules of thumb, but such rules are largely acquired through practice (often in formal apprenticeship) and a developed feel or knack for strategy. Mētis resists simplification into deductive principles which can successfully be transmitted through book learning, because the environments in which it is exercised are so complex and nonrepeatable that formal procedures of rational decision making are impossible to apply. (p. 316)

> Why are the rules of thumb that can be derived from any skilled craft still woefully inadequate to its practice? Artists or cooks, Michael Oakeshott has noted, may in fact write about their art and try to boil it down to technical knowledge, but what they write represents not much of what they know but rather only that small part of their knowledge that can be reduced to exposition. Knowing a craft’s shorthand rules is a very long way from its accomplished performance: 'These rules and principles are mere abridgements of the activity itself; they do not exist in advance of the activity, they cannot properly be said to govern it and they cannot provide the impetus of the activity. A complete mastery of the principles may exist alongside a complete inability to pursue the activity to which they refer, for the pursuit of the activity does not consist in the application of these principles; and even if it did, the knowledge of how to apply them (the knowledge of actually pursuing the activity) is not given in a knowledge of them.' (Michael Oakeshott, Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays) (p. 316)

> Knowing how and when to apply the rules of thumb in a concrete situation is the essence of mētis. The subtleties of application are important precisely because mētis is most valuable in settings that are mutable, indeterminant (some facts are unknown), and particular. (p. 316)

> While something can indeed be said about forestry, revolution, urban planning, agriculture, and rural settlement in general, this will take us only so far in understanding this forest, this revolution, this farm. All farming takes place in a unique space (fields, soil, crops) and at a unique time (weather pattern, season, cycle in pest populations) and for unique ends (this family with its needs and tastes). A mechanical application of generic rules that ignores these particularities is an invitation to practical failure, social disillusionment, or most likely both. The generic formula does not and cannot supply the local knowledge that will allow a successful translation of the necessarily crude general understandings to successful, nuanced, local applications. The more general the rules, the more they require in the way of translation if they are to be locally successful. Nor is it simply a matter of the captain or navigator realizing at what point his rules of thumb are inferior to the intimate local knowledge of the pilot. Rather, it is a matter of recognizing that the rules of thumb themselves are largely a codification derived from the actual practices of sailing and piloting. (p. 318)

> One last analogy may help to clarify the relationship between gen|||eral rules of thumb and mētis. Mētis is not merely the specification of local values (such as the local mean temperature and rainfall) made in order to successfully apply a generic formula to a local case. Taking language as a parallel, I believe that the rule of thumb is akin to formal grammar, whereas mētis is more like actual speech. Mētis is no more derivative of general rules than speech is derivative of grammar. (p. 318-319)

> Even the part of mētis that can be conveyed by rules of thumb is the codification of practical experience. (p. 330)
