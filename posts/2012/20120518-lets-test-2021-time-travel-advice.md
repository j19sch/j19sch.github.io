If I had a time machine and could travel back in time to give myself some advice before attending [Let's Test 20212](http://lets-test.com/),
it would be this:

\- Go!  
\- Don't worry too much about which session to attend. One of the most valuable sessions you will attend, you'll choose because it has the least appealing abstract.  
\- Bring your running gear.  
\- If you ask Rikard Edgren nicely, he will give you a dead-tree version of his '[Little Black Book on Test Design](http://www.thetesteye.com/papers/TheLittleBlackBookOnTestDesign.pdf)'.  
\- Enjoy the food. Don't worry, it's not much of a challenge.<!-- TEASER_END -->  
\- Say something during open season.  
\- You have not been to Sweden, if you don't know the meaning of 'lagom' and 'fika'.  
\- Talk to people during meals, at the bar, whenever. You might just meet someone who tests some of the sytems in a Saab fighter plane. Or get to learn a thing or two about ice hockey. Who knows?  
\- When a speaker asks for volunteers, raise your hand. You get to do cool stuff then, like coaching another tester through Skype.  
\- Stay up until the small hours. There's enough energy at the conference to get by with a few hours of sleep a night.  
\- Talk to [Alan Richardson](http://www.eviltester.com/). He has interesting stuff to stay about mental processes in testing.  
\- When information overload hits you, go take a walk in the nature reserve.  
\- It is not possible to spend too much time at the test lab.

*Note: Some of the stuff above I did do, some of it I didn't. And no, I'm not telling you which is which.*
