<html><body><p>If I had a time machine and could travel back in time to give myself some advice before attending <a href="http://lets-test.com/">Let's Test 2021</a>,
it would be this:
</p><ul>
<li>Go!</li>
<li>Don't worry too much about which session to attend. One of the most valuable sessions you will attend, you'll choose because it has the <strong>least</strong> appealing abstract.</li>
<li>Bring your running gear.</li>
<li>If you ask Rikard Edgren nicely, he will give you a dead-tree version of his '<a href="http://www.thetesteye.com/papers/TheLittleBlackBookOnTestDesign.pdf">Little Black Book on Test Design</a>'.</li>
<li>Enjoy the food. Don't worry, it's not much of a challenge.</li>
<li>Say something during open season.</li>
<li>You have not been to Sweden, if you don't know the meaning of 'lagom' and 'fika'.</li>
<li>Talk to people during meals, at the bar, whenever. You might just meet someone who tests some of the sytems in a Saab fighter plane. Or get to learn a thing or two about ice hockey. Who knows?</li>
<li>When a speaker asks for volunteers, raise your hand. You get to do cool stuff then, like coaching another tester through Skype.</li>
<li>Stay up until the small hours. There's enough energy at the conference to get by with a few hours of sleep a night.</li>
<li>Talk to <a href="http://www.eviltester.com/">Alan Richardson</a>. He has interesting stuff to stay about mental processes in testing.</li>
<li>When information overload hits you, go take a walk in the nature reserve.</li>
<li>It is not possible to spend too much time at the test lab.</li>
</ul>
<em>Note: Some of the stuff above I did do, some of it I didn't. And no, I'm not telling you which is which.</em></body></html>
