# The five levels

## level 0: no one takes notes

Few things confuse me as much as being a meeting with no one taking notes. Is everyone's memory so much better than my own that they'll remember everything? Is what's being said just not that important? Are people fine with only retaining a few high-level items and none of the context?

Luckily [Johanna Rothman](https://www.jrothman.com/) seems to agree with me, at least for __essential__ meetings[^1]:

> *If a meeting is essential, it will have an agenda. It will have minutes. It will have a list of action items, and someone will manage them so that people are accountable for their action items.*  
- [Modern Management Made Easy](https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy) by [Johanna Rothman](https://www.jrothman.com/)

[^1]: Tip: If a meeting is not essential, politely decline and go do something else. Get some work done, take some time to reflect, go out for a walk.

And there's no reason to ever be at this level. Borrow some pen and paper, use your phone, at least take notes for yourself.


## level 1: people take notes for themselves

There are multiple reasons I like to take notes (at least) for myself during meetings. Often enough I have trouble staying focused during a meeting. Taking notes helps my mind not to wander off.

Taking notes also helps me remember what important things where said during a meeting. I know my memory on its own is not good enough to remember it all. Taking notes helps with remembering in two ways. First of all, I can refer to my notes both during and after the meeting. Secondly, taking notes helps me with remembering / storing into memory.

Which brings us to a key skill for note-taking. The ability to listen to being said, while identifying what's of importance and then writing that down. I first noticed I was able to do this in a class at university. I was taking notes and noticed that while I was listening to what the professor was saying, my hand was writing down the essence of what he had just said. It was a weird sensation, more about letting my mind and body do this, then being actively involved in actually doing it. Without this skill, taking notes is near impossible. You can't ask participants to wait a few seconds every time they've said something, so you can take notes.

The main benefit I experience from taking notes for myself is that it helps me to listen to understand, more than listen to respond. I need to understand what someone is saying to be able to take note(s) of what they just said. I also don't need to keep track in my head of all the things I wanted to say. The things I want to respond to, are in my notes. And if needed, I can make a quick note on what I want to say in response to something.

So in short, taking notes for myself allows me to engage more fully in the meeting. I can participate in the moment, because there's a lot less I need to keep track of in my head.



## level 2: one person takes notes and shares afterwards


Something that tends to happen when a single person is responsible for taking notes, is that it's seen as a low-status task. The least important person in the room is the one that gets to take the notes. Even worse, often you get to reverse effect. By volunteering to take notes, you make yourself the least important person on the room. Because you're no longer participating in the meeting, you're serving the meeting. And thus the people in it.

Once I even saw it being framed as something close to a punishment / saw this being made almost explicit by turning note-taksing into something of a punishment. Someone suggested that the last person to join the meeting, had to take the notes. In response I said that I would take notes for every meeting until someone else volunteered to take over, because I didn't want note-taking to be seen as a punishment. Luckily I had the privilege in that situation to do this without any adverse effects.
