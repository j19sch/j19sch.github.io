# The five levels

## level 0: no one takes notes

Few things confuse me as much as being a meeting with no one taking notes. Is everyone's memory so much better than my own that they'll remember everything? Is what's being said just not that important? Are people fine with only retaining a few high-level items and none of the context?

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Luckily [Johanna Rothman](https://www.jrothman.com/) seems to agree with me, at least for __essential__ meetings[^1]:

> *If a meeting is essential, it will have an agenda. It will have minutes. It will have a list of action items, and someone will manage them so that people are accountable for their action items.*  
- [Modern Management Made Easy](https://leanpub.com/b/modernmanagementmadeeasy) by [Johanna Rothman](https://www.jrothman.com/)

[^1]: Tip: If a meeting is not essential, politely decline and go do something else. Get some work done, take some time to reflect, go out for a walk.

And there's no reason to ever be at this level. Borrow some pen and paper, use your phone, at least take notes for yourself.


## level 1: take notes for yourself

There are multiple reasons I like to take notes (at least) for myself during meetings. Often enough I have trouble staying focused during a meeting. Taking notes helps my mind not to wander off.

Taking notes also helps me remember what important things where said during a meeting. I know my memory on its own is not good enough to remember it all. Taking notes helps with remembering in two ways. First of all, I can refer to my notes both during and after the meeting. Secondly, taking notes helps me with remembering / storing into memory.

Which brings us to a key skill for note-taking. The ability to listen to being said, while identifying what's of importance and then writing that down. I first noticed I was able to do this in a class at university. I was taking notes and noticed that while I was listening to what the professor was saying, my hand was writing down the essence of what he had just said. It was a weird sensation, more about letting my mind and body do this, then being actively involved in actually doing it. Without this skill, taking notes is near impossible. You can't ask participants to wait a few seconds every time they've said something, so you can take notes.

The main benefit I experience from taking notes for myself is that it helps me to listen to understand, more than listen to respond. I need to understand what someone is saying to be able to take note(s) of what they just said. I also don't need to keep track in my head of all the things I wanted to say. The things I want to respond to, are in my notes. And if needed, I can make a quick note on what I want to say in response to something.

So in short, taking notes for myself allows me to engage more fully in the meeting. I can participate in the moment, because there's a lot less I need to keep track of in my head.


## level 2: one person takes notes and shares afterwards

One step up from taking notes for yourself is one person taking notes and sharing those with the other participants afterwards. It's far from great, though, because of the power dynamics it creates.

Note-taking tends to be seen as a low-status job. It's what important men hire women they call personal assistants, for to do it for them. So being the person who takes notes, makes you the least important person in the room. You're no longer participating in the meeting, you're serving the meeting. And thus the people in it. So if you ask who wants to take notes, you're asking if someone wants to reduce their status in the meeting. And if you volunteer to take notes...

As someone who ticks almost every privilege checkbox[^2], I'm not the best person to speak to this topic or share experiences. In most situations I can afford to be the person taking notes. And if I want to be a good ally, I have two options. Volunteer to take notes and try to give it more status. Or change how the meeting is run and move the note-taking to one of the levels I describe below.

[^2]: For Dutch-speaking people: check out Joris Luyendijk's [zeven vinkjes](https://www.jorisluyendijk.nl/index_p_4147.html). I score seven out of seven.

You might say that with note-taking comes a certain kind of power. Deciding what gets recorded and how. While that's definitely true, I don't think it offsets the low status of note-taking at this level. Rather, the power in note-taking is part of the power of facilitating the meeting. Which is something that happens in the next levels.


## level 3: one person takes notes and shares during

Another thing that confuses me in meeting is when people don't share things. Instead of using a whiteboard, they talk about what they see in their head. Instead of sharing their screen, they talk about what they see on their screen. Instead of sharing the notes as they make them, they keep them to themself until after the meeting. It doesn't have to be this way.

At this level the notes become a shared tool that's part of the meeting. Participants can see how the notes are taking shape. They can ask to include or exclude certain things. For something to be phrased differently. They can refer to the notes, when they want to say something.


## level 4: collaborative note-taking

A small but significant step up from the previous level, is taking the notes in a collaborative tool all the participants have access to. It turns the notes into a shared responsibility. It's something you work on together as part of the meeting.

That's not to say everyone should equally contribute to the notes. Some people might not be comfortable doing so. Perhaps they can't type that fast. Perhaps they're dyslexic. Perhaps they have bad experiences with being volunteered to take notes. The reason doesn't matter. As long as there are several people involved in taking the notes. So that if you're taking notes and want to say something, you can rely on someone else taking over the note-taking.


## level 5: note-taking is part of the meeting structure

The difference between this level and the previous one can be subtle, but it is there. At this level the not-taking is an integral part of how the meeting works. Basically think of writing post-its, either of the physical or the virtual kind. Or of several people collaborating at a whiteboard.

The notes become more than a tool for recording what was said, they become a tool to structure the meeting. They become part of what's being said and how. That does mean that sometimes it'll take some effort to turn these notes into something that's useful long-term. To me, that's worth it, because the more a meeting looks like a workshop, the better the meeting tends to be.

consumer versus participant

generative work versus productive work (Maaret) -> https://visible-quality.blogspot.com/search?q=generative

> In thinking of the way I track my balance, I realized I have two dimension I think in. The first dimension is in where the results of my work show: are my results productive in nature (I do something) or generative in nature (others do something better because of me). The second dimension is the payback time, when the benefits are available: right about now or next week (short-term) or later in life (long-term). The long term in the context of a company is a year or two, and in life decades, but thinking around using my work hours, I'm quite aware of looking of reaping the benefits for this company.
