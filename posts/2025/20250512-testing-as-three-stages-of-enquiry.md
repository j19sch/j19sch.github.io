The product of testing is information. (The product of good testing is actionable, relevant information, but that's another blog post.) So how does that information come about?

In my post ["The nine skills of exploratory testing"](link://slug/the-nine-skills-of-exploratory-testing) I wrote:

> As you explore, as you try things and notice how what you're testing responds, you build a model of how something might work. This kind of thinking is called [abduction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/) or abductive reasoning.

If you follow that link, you'll notice that it covers *"abduction in the modern sense"*, but that there's also a historical sense *"which had its origin in the work of Charles Sanders Peirce"*.

This historical sense is described in the supplement ["Peirce on Abduction"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/peirce.html), which refers to Fann 1970 for a *"a concise yet thorough account of the development of Peirceâ€™s thoughts about abduction"*. So of course I bought that book, i.e. "Peirce's Theory of Abduction" by K. T. Fann. (I really like that this 63-page book that's over a 50 years old, apparantly is __the__ reference on this topic.)

And in that book I found something more interesting than just abduction: Peirce's three stages of inquiry. Or how the three phases of the methodology of science are abduction - deduction - induction. And it seem to me that testing works in a very similar way.[^1]

[^1]: I very deliberately wrote "in a very similar way". Because this blog post is no more than that: noticing an interesting similarity between what I understand of Peirce's thoughts based on Fann's book and what I believe about testing. If I'd want to make a stronger claim, e.g. about the similarities between testing and science, or about Peirce correctly describing the scientific method, I'd have to do a lot more reading and studying.
