In [a previous post](link://slug/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto#noticing-options-principles) I claimed that any set of principles for good software development should cover these five areas:
- collaboration
- software engineering
- work management
- product
- reflect & experiment

I mentioned these five again in my post ["What is a scrum master?"](link://slug/what-is-a-scrum-master), but that's all I've said about them. That changes today. I will provide a brief description for each. And share some ideas why it might be useful to have a list of the five areas of Agile. But first, are they the five areas of good software development or of Agile software development?

# Agile software development or software development in general?

Looking up that [old post from 2021](link://slug/an-approach-to-teaching-agile-20-years-after-the-agile-manifesto) I was surprised to see I bring up these areas as the five areas of good software development. And that a set of principles should cover all five of these areas. On the other hand, the title of the post is *"An approach to teaching Agile 20 years after the Agile Manifesto"*. So I guess I was equating good software development with Agile software development.

Because if I had had to come up with five areas of good waterfall software development, I don't think I would have come up with the same list. I'd probably keep "software engineering" and "product", even though what they would look like would be different. "Collaboration" would change into something that implies more handovers and documentation. "Work management" would become "project management". And "reflect & experiment" would become "governance and steering"?

So in a way the change would not be that dramatic. Software engineering is still software engineering. But I can't deny that the words I chose for these five areas have a distinct Agile flavor to them.


# Three ideas where this might be useful

So great that we can now divide Agile into five areas, but how is that useful? Sure we can use it to categorise principles as I mentioned above. Or skills. But that's stil descriptive. It doesn't change what we do.

## Is this methodology complete?

One thing the five areas lets us do, is evaluate a software development methodology for completeness.

In my 2023 post *"What is a scrum master?"* [I wrote](link://slug/what-is-a-scrum-master#a-scrum-master-knows-more-than-scrum):

> Scrum definitely covers work management and reflect & experiment. Arguably it covers collaboration (as in: soft skills) to some degree. It does not cover software engineering, because it's not specific to software. And it does not cover product. The Scrum Guide (2020) does say *"The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team."* but provides no guidance on how exactly to do this.

Which is also the reason that originally[^1] Scrum advocated for combining it with Extreme Programming.

[^1]: *"Agile Software Development with Scrum"* by Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle from 2001. See my post [*"Old-school Scrum was rad!"*](link://slug/old-school-scrum-was-rad) for three things that struck me in the version of Scrum described in that book.

So if you ask someone how they do software development and they reply *"We're Agile. We do Scrum."*, you know that's not the complete story. Significant parts are missing. What that means will depend on the organisation. In most cases though, it will mean that Agile has been reduced to teams delivering pieces of work in two week-sprints, while doing all the [Scrum Events](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-events). So a hollow shell of what Agile could be.


## Does my team cover all five?
are we cross-functional
do we get to do all five?
control vs influence vs ???


## Where can we improve?
maturity model

What do you think? Makes sense? Can be useful?
