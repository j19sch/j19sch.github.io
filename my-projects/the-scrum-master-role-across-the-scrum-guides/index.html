<p>This version has 20 mentions of&nbsp;&#8220;ScrumMaster&#8221;.</p>
<h4>The&nbsp;ScrumMaster</h4>
<p>The ScrumMaster is responsible for ensuring that Scrum values, practices and rules are enacted and enforced. The ScrumMaster is the driving force behind all of the Scrum and helps the Scrum Team and the organization adopt and use Scrum to produce a higher quality product. The ScrumMaster is not the manager but leads by coaching, teaching and supporting the team. The ScrumMaster helps the Team understand and use selfmanagement and&nbsp;cross-functionality.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TIP</span>: The ScrumMaster works with the customers and management to identify and instantiate a Product Owner. The ScrumMaster teaches the Product Owner how to do his or her job, in order to optimize the value of the use Scrum. If they don’t, the ScrumMaster is held&nbsp;accountable.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TIP</span>: The ScrumMaster may be part of the Team such as a developer performing Sprint tasks. However, if this is the case, there may be conflict between removing impediments and performing tasks. The ScrumMaster is never the Product&nbsp;Owner.</p>
