## FroGS conf
With some other fine people I organise the Friends of Good Software ([FroGS](https://frogsconf.nl/)) conference. It's an open space conference focusing on quality and software. And it's the successor of [TestCraftCamp](https://testcraftcamp.nl/).

## Building an API testing framework

Full-day workshop in which you build an API testing framework from scratch using Python, pytest, and the requsts library. All materials can be found
[here](https://github.com/j19sch/building-an-api-testing-framework). These also include examples of next steps and a single test implemented
in using different Python libraries, such as tavern, robot and behave.

## Pytest plugins

Pytest-instrument ([PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-instrument/), [GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/pytest-instrument)) is a plugin to instrument your tests, so you can have the raw event data of your tests in a file of json objects.

Pytest-logfest ([PiPy](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-logfest/), [GitHub](https://github.com/j19sch/pytest-logfest)) is a plugin that provides three logger fixtures which can write all log records or only those of failed tests to file.

## Learning Clojure
In April 2020 I decided I wanted to learn [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) (because functional programming and Lisp) and write about the process. You can find an overview page of what I've written so far [here](/my-projects/learning-clojure).
